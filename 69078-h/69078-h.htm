<p class="drop-cap">WHETHER the “great man” has had any
real influence on the world, or whether
history is merely a matter of ideas and tendencies
among mankind, are still questions open to solution;
but there is no doubt that great persons
are still interesting; and it is the aim of this
series of essays to throw such light upon them
as is possible as regards their physical condition;
and to consider how far their actions
were influenced by their health. There are
many remarkable people in history about whom
we know too little to dogmatize, though we may
strongly suspect that their mental and physical
conditions were abnormal when they were driven
to take actions which have passed into history;
for instances, Mahomet and St. Paul. Such I
have purposely omitted. But there were far
more whose actions were clearly the result of
their state of health; and some of these who
happen to have been leaders at critical epochs I
have ventured to study from the point of view
of a doctor. This point of view appears to have
been strangely neglected by historians and
others. If the background against which it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
shows its heroes and heroines should appear
unsentimental and harsh, at least it appears to
medical opinion as probably true; and it is our
duty to seek Truth. If it appears to assume an
iconoclastic attitude towards many ideals I am
sorry, and can only wish that the patina cast
upon their characters were more sentimental
and beautiful.</p>

<p>Jeanne d’Arc and the Emperor Charles V were
undoubtedly heroic figures who have been almost
worshipped by many millions of people; yet
undoubtedly they were human and subject to
the unhappy frailties of other people. This in
no way detracts from their renown. I must
apologize for treating Don Quixote as a real person;
he was quite as much a living individual as
anyone in history. Through his glamour we can
get a real glimpse of the character of Cervantes.</p>

<p>In Australia we have no access to the original
sources of European history; we must rely upon
the “printed word” as it appears in standard
monographs and essays.</p>

<p>I owe many thanks to Miss Kibble, of the
research department of the Sydney Public
Library, without whose help this work could
never have been undertaken.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">The Case of Anne Boleyn</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE is something Greek, something akin
to Œdipus and Thyestes, in the tragedy
of Anne Boleyn. It is difficult to believe, as we
read it, that we are viewing the actions of real
people subject to passions violent indeed yet
common to those of mankind, and not the
creatures of a nightmare. Yet I believe that
the conduct of the three protagonists, Henry,
Catherine, and Anne, can all be explained if we
appreciate the facts and interpret them with the
aid of a little medical knowledge and insight.
Let us search for this explanation. Needless to
say we shall not get it in the strongly Bowdlerized
sketches that most of us have learnt at school;
it is a pity that such rubbish should be taught,
because this period is one of the most important
in English history; the actors played vital parts;
and upon the drama that they played has depended
the history of England ever since.</p>

<p>In considering an historical drama one has to
remember the curtain of gauze which Time has
drawn before us, and to allow for its colour and
density. In the case of Henry VIII and his
time, though the actual materials are enormous,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
yet everything has to be viewed through an <i>odium
theologicum</i> that is unparalleled since the days of
Theodora. In the eyes of the Catholics, Henry
was, if not the actual devil incarnate, at all
events the next thing; and their opinion has
survived among many people who ought to know
better to the present day. Decidedly we must
make a great deal of allowance.</p>

<p>Henry succeeded to the throne, nineteen years
of age, handsome, rather free-living, full of <i>joie-de-vivre</i>,
charming, and with every promise of
greatness and happiness. He died at fifty-five,
unhappy, worn down with illness, at enmity with
his people, with the Church, and with the world
in general, leaving a memory in the popular mind
of a murderous concupiscence that has become a
byword. About the time that he was a young
man, syphilis, which is supposed to have been
introduced by Columbus’ men, ran like a whirlwind
through Europe. Hardly anyone seems to
have escaped, and it was said that even the Pope
upon the throne of St. Peter went the way of
most other people, though it is possible that
this accusation was as unreliable as many other
accusations against the popes. Be that as it may,
the foundations were then laid for that syphilization
which has transformed the disease into its
present mildness. It is impossible to doubt that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Henry contracted it in his youth<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>; the evidence
will become clear to any doctor as we proceed.</p>

<p>The first act of his reign was to marry for
political reasons Catherine of Aragon, who was
the widow of his elder brother Arthur. She was
daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, and,
though far from beautiful, proved herself to
possess a great and noble soul and a courage of
well-tempered steel. The English people took
her to their hearts, and when unmerited misfortune
fell upon her never lost the love they
had felt for her when she was a happy young
woman. Though she was six years older than
Henry, the two lived happily together for many
years. Seven months after marriage Catherine
was delivered of a daughter, still-born. Eight
months later she had a son, who lived three days.
Two years later she had a still-born son. Nine
months later she had a son, who died in early
infancy, and eighteen months afterwards the
infant was born who was to live to be Queen
Mary. Henry was intensely disappointed, and
for the first time turned against his wife. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
was all important to produce an heir to the
throne, for it was thought that no woman could
rule England. No woman had ever ruled England,
save only Matilda, and her precedent was
not alluring. So Henry longed desperately for
a son; nevertheless as the little Mary grew up—a
sickly child—he became passionately devoted
to her. She grew up, as one can see from her
well-known portrait, probably an hereditary syphilitic.
For a time Henry had thought of divorcing
Catherine, but his affection for Mary probably
turned the scale in her mother’s favour. Catherine
had several more miscarriages, and by the time
she was forty-two ceased to menstruate; it became
clear that she would have no more children and
could never produce an heir to the throne.</p>

MARY TUDOR.<br />

From a portrait by Moro Antonio (Madrid, Prado).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>During these years Henry’s morals had been
no worse than those of any other prince in Europe;
certainly better than Louis XIV and XV, who
were to come after him, or Charles II. He met
Mary Boleyn, daughter of a rich London merchant,
and made her his mistress. Later on he
met Anne Boleyn, her sister, a girl of sixteen,
and fell in love. We have a very good description
of her, and several portraits. She was of
medium stature, not handsome, with a long
neck, wide mouth, bosom “not much raised,”
eyes black and beautiful and a knowledge of how
to use them. Her hair was long, and it appears
that she used to wear it long and flowing in the
house. It was not so very long since Joan of
Arc had been burnt largely because she went
about without a wimple, and Mistress Anne’s
conduct with regard to her hair was probably
worse in those days than for a girl to be seen
smoking cigarettes when driving a motor-car
to-day. At any rate, she acquired demerit by
it, and everybody was on the look-out for more
serious false steps. The truth seems to be—so
far as one can ascertain truth from reports which,
even if unprejudiced, came from people who knew
nothing about a woman’s heart—that she was a
bold and ambitious girl who laid herself out to
capture Henry, and succeeded. Mary Boleyn
was thrust aside, and Henry paid violent court in
his own enormous and impassioned way to Anne.
We have some of his love letters; there can be
no doubt of his sincerity, or that his love for
Anne was, while it lasted, the great passion of
his life. Had she behaved herself she might
have retained that love. She repulsed him for
several years, and we can see the idea of divorce
gradually growing in his mind. He appealed to
Pope Clement VII to help him. Catherine
defended herself bravely, and stirred Europe in
her cause. The Pope hesitated, crushed between<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the hammer and the anvil, between Henry
and the Emperor Charles V. Henry discovered
that his marriage with Catherine had come
within the prohibited degrees, and that she
had never been his wife at all. It was a matter
of doubt then—and I believe still is—whether
the Pope’s dispensation could acquit them of
mortal sin. Apparently even his Holiness’ influence
would not have been sufficient to counterbalance
the crime of marrying his deceased
brother’s widow; nevertheless it was rather
remarkable that, if Henry were really such a
stickler for the forms of canon law as he now
wished to make out, he never troubled to raise
the question until after he had fallen in love with
some one else. He definitely promised Anne
that he would divorce Catherine, marry Anne,
and make her Queen of England. Secure in his
promise, Anne yielded to her lover, seeing radiant
visions of glory before her. How foolish would
any girl be who let slip the chance—nay, the
certainty—of being the Queen! Yet she was
to discover that even queens can be bitterly
unhappy. Anne sprang joyfully into the unknown,
as many a girl has done before her and
since, trusting to her power to charm her lover;
and became pregnant. Meanwhile the struggle
for the divorce proceeded, the Pope swaying this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
way and that, and Catherine defending her
honour and her throne with splendid courage.
The nurses and astrologers declared that the
fœtus was a son, and the lovers, mad with joy,
were married in secret, divorce or no divorce.
The obliging Archbishop Cranmer pronounced
that the marriage with Catherine was null and
void, as the Pope would not do so.</p>

<p>The time came for Anne to fulfil her promise
and provide an heir. King and queen anticipated
the event in the wildest excitement. There
had been several lovers’ quarrels, which had been
made up in the usual manner; once Henry was
heard to say passionately that he would rather
beg his bread in the streets than desert her. Yet
it is doubtful whether Anne Boleyn was ever
anything more than an ambitious courtesan;
it is doubtful whether she ever felt anything
towards him but her natural wish to be queen. In
due course her baby was born, and it was a girl—the
girl who afterwards became Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Henry’s disappointment was tragic, and for the
first time Anne began to realize the terror of her
position. She was detested by the people and
the Court, who were emphatically on the side of
the noble woman whom she had supplanted. She
had estranged everybody by her vain-glory and
arrogance in the hour of her triumph; and it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
began to be whispered that even if her own
marriage were legal while Catherine was still
alive, yet it was illegal by the canon law, for Mary
Boleyn, her sister, had been Henry’s wife in all
but name. Canonically speaking, Henry had
done no better by marrying her than by marrying
Catherine. A horrible story went around that
he had been familiar with her mother first, and
that Anne was his own daughter, and moreover
that he knew it. I think we can definitely and
at once put this aside as an ecclesiastical lie; there
is absolutely no evidence for it and it is impossible
to conceive two persons more unlike than the
little lively brunette and the great fresh-faced
“bluff King Hal.” Moreover, Henry denied
the story absolutely, and whatever else he was,
he was a man who was never afraid to tell the
truth. Most of the difficulties in understanding
this complex period of our history disappear if
we believe Henry’s own simple statements; but
these suffer from the incredulity which
Bismarck found three hundred years later when
he told his rivals the plain unvarnished truth.</p>

<p>Let us anticipate events a little and narrate
the death of Catherine, which took place in 1536,
nearly three years after the birth of Elizabeth.
The very brief and sketchy accounts which have
survived give me the impression that she died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
of uræmia, but no definite opinion can be given.
Henry, of course, lay under the immediate charge
of having poisoned her, but I do not know that
anybody believed it very seriously. So died this
unhappy and well-beloved lady, to whom life
meant little but a series of bitter misfortunes.</p>

<p>After Elizabeth was born the tragedy began to
move with terrible impetus towards its climax.
Henry developed an intractable ulcer on his
thigh, which persisted till his death, and frequently
caused him severe agony whenever the
sinus closed. He became corpulent, the result
of over-eating and over-drinking. He had been
immensely worried for years over the affair of
Catherine; as a result his blood-pressure seems
to have risen, so that he was affected by frightful
headaches, which often incapacitated him from
work for days together. He gave up the athleticism
which had distinguished his resplendent
youth, aged rapidly, and became a harassed,
violent, ill-tempered middle-aged man—not at
all the sort of man to turn into a cuckold.</p>

<p>Yet this is precisely what Anne did. Less
than a month after Elizabeth was born—while
she was still in the puerperal state—she solicited
Sir Henry Norreys, the most intimate friend of
the King, to be her lover. A week later, on
October 17th, 1533, he yielded. During the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
next couple of years Anne seems to have gone
absolutely out of her senses, if the contemporary
stories are true. She seems to have solicited
several prominent men of the Court, and even
to have stooped to one of the musicians; worst
of all, it was said that she had committed incest
with her brother, Lord Rocheford. Nor did she
behave with the ordinary consideration for the
feelings of others that might have brought her
hosts of friends—remember, she was a queen!—should
the time ever come when she should need
them. It does not require any great amount of
civility on the part of a queen to win friends.
Arrogant and overbearing, she estranged everybody
at Court; she acted like a beggar on horseback,
and was left without a friend in the place.
And she, who owed her husband such a world,
behaved towards him with the same arrogance
as she showed to others, and in addition jealousy
both concerning other women whom she feared
and concerning the King’s beloved daughter,
Mary. She spoke to the Duke of Norfolk—her
uncle on the mother’s side, and one of the
greatest peers of the realm—“like a dog”; as
he turned away he muttered that she was “une
grande putaine.” The most polite interpretation
of the French word is “strumpet.” When the
Duke used such a word to his own niece, what sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
of reputation must have been gathering about
her?</p>

<p>She had two more miscarriages. After the
second the King’s fury flamed out, and he told
her plainly that he deeply regretted having
married her. He must have indeed been sorry;
he had abandoned a good woman for a bad; for
her he had quarrelled with the Pope and with
many of his subjects; whatever conscience he
had must have been tormenting him: all these
things for the sake of an heir, which seemed as
hopelessly unprocurable as ever. Both the
women seemed affected by some fate which
condemned them to perpetual miscarriages; this
fate, of course, was Henry’s own syphilis, even
supposing that neither wife had contracted it
independently. (It is much to Anne Boleyn’s
credit or discredit, that to a syphilitic husband
she bore a daughter so vigorous as Elizabeth,
though Professor Chamberlin does not appear to
think very highly of her health.)</p>

<p>Meanwhile all sorts of scandalous rumours
were flying about; and finally a maid of honour,
whose chastity had been impugned, told a Privy
Councillor that no doubt she herself was no
better than she should be, but that at any rate
her Majesty Queen Anne was far worse. The Privy
Councillor related this to Thomas Cromwell; he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the rumours being thus focussed, dared to tell
the King. Henry changed colour, and ordered
a secret inquiry to be held. At this inquiry the
ladies of the bedchamber were strictly cross-examined,
but nothing was allowed to happen for
a few days, when a secret commission was appointed,
consisting of the Chancellor, the judges,
Thomas Cromwell, and other members of the
Council. Sir William Brereton was first sent
to the Tower, then the musician Smeaton. Next
day there was a tournament at Greenwich, in the
midst of which Henry suddenly rose and left the
scene, taking Norreys with him. Anne was
brought before the Commission next day, and
committed to the Tower, where she found that
Sir Francis Weston had preceded her. Lord
Rocheford, her brother, joined her almost
immediately on the charge of incest.</p>

<p>The Grand Juries of Kent and Middlesex
returned true bills on the cases, and the Commission
drew up an indictment, giving names,
places, and dates for every alleged act. The
four commoners were put on trial at Westminster
Hall. Anne’s father, Lord Wiltshire,
though he volunteered to sit, was excused attendance,
since a verdict of guilty against the men
would necessarily involve his daughter. One
may read this either way, against or in favour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
Anne. Either Wiltshire was enraged at her
folly, and merely wished to end her disgrace; or
it may be that he thought he would be able to
sway the Court in her favour. Possibly he was
afraid of the King and wished to show that he
at least was on his royal side, however badly
Anne may have behaved. In dealing with a
harsh and tyrannical man like Henry VIII it is
difficult to assess human motives, and one prefers
to think that Wiltshire was trying to do his best
for his daughter. Smeaton the musician confessed
under torture; the other three protested
their innocence, but were found guilty and were
sentenced to death. Thomas Cromwell, in a
letter, said that the evidence was so abominable
that it could not be published. Evidently
the Court of England had suddenly become
squeamish.</p>

<p>Anne was next brought to trial before twenty-five
peers of the realm, her uncle the Duke of
Norfolk being in the chair. Probably, if the
story just related were true, the Duke’s influence
would not be exerted very strongly in her favour,
and she was convicted and sentenced to be hanged
or burnt at the King’s pleasure; her brother was
tried separately and also convicted. It is said
that her father and uncle concurred in the verdict;
they may have been afraid of their own heads.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
On the other hand, it is possible that Anne was
really guilty; unfortunately the evidence has
perished. The five men were executed on Tower
Hill in the presence of the woman, whose death
was postponed from day to day. In the meantime
Henry procured his divorce from her, while
Anne, in a state of violent hysteria, continuously
protested her innocence. On the night before
her execution she said that the people would call
her “Queen Anne sans tête,” laughing wildly as
she spoke; if one pronounces these words in the
French manner, without verbal accent, they form
a sort of jingle, as who should say “ta-ta-ta-ta”;
and this foolish jingle seems to have run in her
head, as she kept repeating it all the evening; and
she placed her fingers around her slender neck—almost
her only beauty—saying that the executioner
would have little trouble, as though it
were a great joke. These things were put to the
account of her light and frivolous nature, and
have probably weighed heavily with posterity in
attempting to judge her case; but it is clear that
they were merely manifestations of hysteria.
Joan of Arc, whose character was probably the
direct antithesis of Anne Boleyn’s, laughed when
she heard the news of her reprieve. Some people
think she laughed ironically, as though a very
simple peasant-girl could be ironical if she tried.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
Irony is a quality of the higher intelligence.
But cannot a girl be allowed to laugh hysterically
for joy? Or cannot Anne Boleyn be allowed to
laugh hysterically for grief and terror without
being called light and frivolous? So little did her
contemporaries understand the human heart. A
few years later came one Shakespeare, who could
have told King Henry differently; and the
extraordinary burgeoning forth of the English
intellect in William Shakespeare is one of the
most wonderful things in our history. Before
the century had terminated in which Anne Boleyn
had been considered light and frivolous because
she had laughed in the shadow of the block,
Shakespeare had plumbed the depths of human
nature.</p>

<p>Anne was beheaded on May 19th, 1536, in the
Tower, on a platform covered thickly with straw,
in which lay hidden a broadsword. The headsman
was a noted expert brought over specially
from St. Omer, and he stood motionless among
the gentlemen onlookers until the necessary
preliminaries had been completed. Then, Anne
kneeling in prayer and her back being turned
towards him, he stole silently forward, seized the
sword from its hiding-place, and severed her
slender neck at a blow. As she had predicted,
he had little trouble, and she never saw either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
her executioner or the sword that slew her.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Her
body and severed head were bundled into a cask,
and were buried within the precincts of the Tower;
and Henry threw his cap into the air for joy.
On the same day he obtained a special dispensation
to marry Jane Seymour. He married her next
day.</p>

<p>The chief authority for the reign of Henry
VIII is contained in the <i>Letters and Papers of the
Reign of Henry VIII</i>, edited by Brewer and
Gairdner. This gigantic work, containing more
than 20,000 closely printed pages, is probably the
greatest monument of English scholarship; the
prefaces to the different volumes are remarkable
for their learning and delightful literary style.
Froude’s history is charming and brilliant as
are all his writings, but is now rather out of date,
and is marred by his hero-worship of Henry and
his strong Protestant bias. He sums up absolutely
against Anne, and, after reading the letters which
he publishes, I do not see how he could have done
anything else. He believes her innocent of incest,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
however, and doubtless he is right. Let us acquit
her of this crime, at any rate. A. F. Pollard’s
<i>Life of Henry VIII</i> is meticulously accurate, and
is charmingly written; he thinks it impossible
that the juries could have found against her and
the court have convicted without the strongest
evidence, which has not survived. P. C. Yorke
sums up rather against her in the <i>Encyclopædia
Britannica</i>; but S. R. Gardiner thinks the
charges too horrible to be believed and that
probably her own only offence was that she
could not bear a son. Professor Gardiner had
evidently seen little of psychological medicine,
or he would have known that no charge is too
horrible to believe. The “Unknown Spaniard”
of the <i>Chronicle of Henry VIII</i> is an illiterate
fellow enough, but no doubt of Anne’s guilt
appears to enter his artless mind; he probably
represents the popular contemporary view. He
says that he took his stand in the ring of gentlemen
who witnessed the execution. He gives an
account of the arrest of Sir Thomas Wyatt
the poet—the first English sonneteer—and the
<i>ipsissima verba</i> of a letter which Wyatt wrote to
Henry, narrating how Anne had solicited him
even before her marriage in circumstances that
rendered her solicitation peculiarly brazen and
shameless. That Henry should have pardoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
him seems to show that the real crime of Anne
was that she had contaminated the blood royal;
a capital offence in a queen in almost all ages and
almost every country. Before she became a
queen Henry was probably complaisant enough
to Anne’s peccadilloes; but afterwards—that was
altogether different. “There’s a divinity doth
hedge” a queen!</p>

<p>Lord Herbert of Cherbury, writing seventy
years later, narrates the ghastly story with very
little feeling one way or the other. Apparently
the legend of Anne’s innocence and Henry’s
blood-lust had not yet arisen. The verdict of
any given historian appears to depend upon
whether he favours the Protestants or the Catholics.
Speaking as a doctor with very little religious
preference one way or the other, the following
considerations appeal strongly to myself. If
Henry wished to get rid of a barren wife—barren
through his own syphilis!—as he undoubtedly
did, then Mark Smeaton’s evidence alone was
enough to hang any queen in history from Helen
downward, especially if taken in conjunction with
the infamous stories related by the “Unknown
Spaniard.” Credible or not, these stories show
the reputation that attached to the plain little
Protestant girl who could not provide an heir
to the throne—the sort of reputation which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
mankind usually attaches to a woman who, by
unworthy means, has attained to a high position.
Why should the King and Cromwell, both
exceedingly able men, gratuitously raise the
questions of incest and promiscuity and send four
innocent men to their deaths absolutely without
reason? Why should they raise all the tremendous
family ill-will and public reprobation which such
an act of bloodthirsty tyranny would have caused?
Stern as they were they never showed any sign
of mere blood-lust at any other time; and the
facts that Anne’s father and uncle both appear to
have concurred in the verdict, and that, except
for her own denial, there is not a word said in her
favour, seems to require a great deal of explanation.</p>

<p>We can thoroughly explain her conduct by
supposing that she was afflicted by hysteria and
nymphomania. There are plenty of accounts
of unhappy women whose cases are parallel to
Anne’s in the works of Havelock-Ellis and Kisch.
There is plenty of indubitable evidence that she
was hysterical and unbalanced, and that she
passionately longed for a son; and it is simpler to
believe her the victim of a well-known and
common disease than that we should suppose
the leading statesmen of England and nearly
the whole of its peerage suddenly to be affected
with blood-lust. It has been suggested that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
Anne, passionately longing for a son and terrified
of her husband’s tyrannical wrath, acted like one
of Thomas Hardy’s heroines centuries later and
tried another lover in the hope that she would
gratify her own and Henry’s wishes. This
course of procedure is probably not so uncommon
as some husbands imagine and would satisfy the
questions of our problem but for Anne’s promiscuity
and vehemence in solicitation. If her sole
object in soliciting Norreys was to provide a
son, why should she have gone from man to man
till the whole Court seems to have been ringing
with her ill fame?</p>

<p>Her spasms of violent temper after her marriage,
her fits of jealousy, her foolish arrogance and
insolence to her friends, are all mental signs
which go with nymphomania, and the fact that
her post-nuptial incontinence seems to have
begun while she was still in the puerperal state
after the birth of her only living child seems
highly significant. It is not uncommon for
sexual desire to become intolerable in nervous
and puerperal women. The proper place for
Anne Boleyn was a mental hospital.</p>

<p>Henry VIII’s case, along with those of his
children, deserve a paper to themselves. Henry
himself died of neglected arterio-sclerosis just
in the nick of time to save the lives of better men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
from the executioner; Catherine Parr, who
married him probably in order to nurse him—it is
possible that she was really fond of him and that
there was even then something attractive about
him—succeeded in outliving him by a remarkable
effort of diplomatic skill and courage, though had
Henry awakened from his uræmic stupor probably
her head would have been added to his
collection. On the whole, one cannot avoid the
conclusion that his conduct to his wives was not
all his fault. They seem to have done no credit
to his power of selection. The first and the
last appear to have been the best, considered as
women.</p>

<p>Inexorable Nemesis had avenged Catherine.
The worry of the divorce left her husband with
an arterial tension which, added to the royal
temper, caused great misery to England and
ultimately death to himself; and her mean
little rival lay huddled in the most frightful
dishonour that ever befell a woman. Decidedly
there is something Greek in the complete horror
of the tragedy.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">The Problem of Jeanne d’Arc</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN 1410-12 France was in the most dreadful
condition that has ever affected any nation.
For nearly eighty years England had been at
her throat in a quarrel which to our minds simply
exemplifies the difference between law and
justice; for it seems that the King of England
had mediæval law on his side, though to our
minds no justice; the Black Death had returned
more than once to harass those whom war had
spared; no man reaped where he had sown, for
his crops fell into the hands of freebooters.
Misery, destitution, and superstition were man’s
bedfellows; and the French mind seemed open
to receive any marvel that promised relief from
its intolerable agony. Into this land of terror
was born a little maid whose mission it was to
right the wrongs of France; a maiden who has
remained, through all the vicissitudes of history,
extraordinarily fascinating, yet an almost insoluble
problem. It is undeniable that she has
exercised a vast influence upon mankind, less by
her actual deeds than by the ideal which she set
up; an ideal of courage, simple faith, and unquenchable
loyalty which has inspired both her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
own nation and the nation which burnt her.
When the English girls cut their hair short in the
worst time of the war;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> when the French soldiers
retook Fort Douaumont when all seemed lost:
these things were done in the name of Joan of Arc.</p>

<p>The actual contemporary sources from which
we draw our ideas are extraordinarily few. There
is of course the report of the trial for lapse and
relapse, which is official and is said not to be
garbled. It is useful, not only for the Maid’s
answers, which throw a good deal of light on her
mentality, but for the questions asked, which
appear to give an idea of reports that seem to
have been floating about France at the time.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
The only thing which interested her judges was
whether she had imperilled her immortal soul
by heresy or witchcraft, and from that trial we
shall get few or no indications of her military
career or physical condition, which are the
things that most interest modern men. About
twenty years after her execution it occurred to
her king, who had repaid her amazing love and
self-sacrifice with neglect, that since she had been
burnt as a witch it followed that he must owe
his crown to a witch; moreover, her mother and
brother had been appealing to him to clear her
memory, for they could not bear that their child
and sister should still remain under a cloud of
sorcery. King Charles VII, who was now a
great man, and very successful as kings go, therefore
ordered the case to be reopened, in which
course he ultimately secured the assistance of the
reigning Pope. Charles could not restore the
Maid to life, but he could make things unpleasant
for the friends of those who had burned her;
and so we have the so-called Rehabilitation Trial,
consisting of reports and opinions, given under
oath, from many people who had known her
when alive. As King Charles was now a great
man, some of the clerics who had helped to
condemn her crowded to give evidence in the
poor child’s favour, attributing the miscarriage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
of justice in her case to people who were now
dead or hopelessly unpopular; some friends of
her childhood came forward and people who had
known her at the time of her glory; and, perhaps
most important, some of her old comrades in
arms rallied round her memory. We thus have
a fairly complete account of her battles, friendships,
trials, character, and death; if we read
this evidence with due care, remembering that
more than twenty years had elapsed and the
mentality of mediæval man, we may take some
of the statements at their face value. Otherwise
there is absolutely no contemporary evidence of
the Maid; Anatole France has pricked the
bubble of the chroniclers and of the Journal of
the siege of Orleans. But there is so much of
pathological interest to be found in the reports
of the trials that I need no excuse for a brief study
of them in that respect.</p>

<p>The record of the life of Jeanne d’Arc is all
too short, and the main facts are not in dispute.
It is the interpretation of these facts that <i>is</i> in
dispute. She was born on January 6th, 1412;
the year is uncertain. Probably she did not
know herself. In the summer of 1424 she saw
a great light on her right hand and heard a voice
telling her to be a good girl. This voice she knew
to be the voice of God. Later on she heard the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
voices of St. Michael the Archangel, of St.
Catherine, and of St. Margaret. St. Michael
appeared first, and warned her to expect the
arrival of the others, who came in due course.
All three were to be her constant companions for
the rest of her life. At first their appearances were
irregular, but later on they came frequently, especially
at quiet moments. Sometimes, when there
was a good deal of noise going on, they appeared
and tried to tell her something, but she could
not hear what they said. These she called her
Council, or her Voices. Occasionally the Lord God
spoke to her himself; Him she called “Messire.”</p>

<p>As Jeanne grew more accustomed to her heavenly
visitors they came in great numbers, and she used
to see vast crowds of angels descending from heaven
to her little garden. She said nothing to anybody
about these unusual events, but grew up a brooding
and intensely religious girl, going to church at
every possible opportunity, and apparently neglecting
her ordinary duties of looking after her
father’s sheep and cattle. She learned to sew and
knit, to say her Credo, Paternoster, and Ave
Maria; otherwise she was absolutely ignorant, and
very simple in mind and honest. She was dreamy
and shy; nor did she ever learn to read or write.</p>

<p>Later on the voices told her to go into France,
and God would help her to drive out the English.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
She continually appealed to her father that he
should send her to Vaucouleurs, where the Sieur
Robert de Baudricourt would espouse her cause.
Ultimately he did so; and at first Robert laughed
at her. He was no saint; in his day he had
ravaged villages with the best noble in the land;
and he was not convinced that Jeanne was really
the sent of God that she claimed. When she
returned home she found herself the butt of
Domremy; nine months later she ran away to
Vaucouleurs again, and found Robert more
helpful. He had for some time felt sympathy
with the dauphin Charles, and had grown to
detest the English and Burgundians; and he now
welcomed the supernatural aid which Jeanne
promised; she repeated vehemently that God
had sent her to deliver France, and that she had
no doubt whatever that she would be able to
raise the siege of Orleans, which was then being
idly invested by the English.</p>

<p>Robert sent her to the Dauphin, who lay at
Chinon. He was no hero, this Dauphin, but a
poverty-stricken ugly man, with spindle-shanks
and bulbous nose, untidy and careless in his dress,
and for ever blown this way and that by the
advice of those around him. Weak, and intensely
superstitious, he would to-day have been the
prey of every medium who cared to attack him;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
he received Jeanne kindly, and ultimately sent
her to Poitiers to be examined as to possible witchcraft
by a great number of learned doctors of the
Church, who could be relied upon to discern a
witch as soon as anybody.</p>

<p>She was deeply offended at being suspected of
witchcraft, and was not so respectful to her
judges as she might have been; occasionally she
sulked, and sometimes she answered the reverend
gentlemen quite saucily. She is an attractive
and very human little figure at Poitiers as she
moves restlessly upon her bench, and repeatedly
tells the doctors that they should need no further
sign than her own deeds; for when she had
relieved Orleans it would be obvious enough that
she was sent directly from God. At Poitiers she
had to run the gauntlet of the inevitable jury of
matrons, who were to certify to her virginity,
because it was well known that women lost their
holiness when they lost their virginity. The
matrons and midwives certified that she was
<i>virgo intacta</i>; how the good ladies knew is not
certain, because even to-day, with all our knowledge
of anatomy and physiology, we often find
it difficult to be assured on this point. However,
there can be little doubt that they were correct;
probably they were impressed with Jeanne’s
obvious sincerity and purity of mind. All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
women seem to have loved Jeanne, which is a
strong point in her favour. The spiritual
examination dragged on for three weeks; these
poor doctors were determined not to let a witch
slip through their hands, and it speaks well for
their patience and good temper, considering how
unmercifully Jeanne had “cheeked” them, that
they ultimately found that she was a good Christian.
Any ordinary man would have seen that
at once; but these gentlemen knew too much
about the wiles of the Devil to be so easily
influenced; and it was a source of bitter injustice
to Jeanne at her real and serious trial for her life
that she was unable to produce their certificate.</p>

<p>The Dauphin took her into his service and
provided her with horse, suit of armour, and
banner, as befitted a knight; also maidservants
to act propriety, page-boy, and a steward, one
Jean d’Aulon. All that we hear of d’Aulon, in
whose hands the honour of the Maid was placed,
is to his credit. A witness at the Rehabilitation
Trial said that he was the wisest and bravest man
in the army. We shall hear more of him.
Throughout the story, whenever he comes upon
the scene we seem to breathe fresh air. He was
the very man for the position, brave, simple-hearted,
and passionately loyal to Jeanne. There
is no reason to doubt that in spite of his close<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
companionship with her there was never any
romantic or other such feeling between them;
he said so definitely, and he is to be believed.
His honour came through it all unstained; and
he let himself be captured with her rather than
desert her. It is clear from his evidence that the
personality of the Maid profoundly affected him.
After Jeanne’s death he was ransomed, and was
made seneschal of Beaucaire.</p>

<p>Jeanne was enormously impressed by her
banner, which was made by a Scotsman, Hamish
Power by name; she described it at her trial.</p>

<p>“I had a banner of white cloth, sprinkled with
lilies; the world was painted there, with an
angel on each side; above them were the words
‘Jhesus Maria.’” When she said “the world”
she meant God holding the world up in one hand
and blessing it with the other. Later on she
does not seem very certain whether “Jhesus
Maria” was above or at the side; but she is very
certain that she was tremendously proud of the
artistic creation—yes, “forty times” prouder
of her banner than of her sword; even though
the sword was from St. Catherine herself, and
was the very sword of Charles Martel centuries
before. When the priests dug it up without
witnesses and rubbed it their holy power cleansed
it immediately of the rust of ages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>When she arrived at Orleans she found the
English carrying on a leisurely blockade by means
of a series of forts between which cattle and men
could enter or leave the city at will. The city
was defended by Jean Dunois, Bastard of Orleans.
The title Bastard implies that he would have been
Duc d’Orleans only that he had the misfortune
to be born of the wrong mother. There have
been several famous bastards in history, and the
kindly morality of the Middle Ages seems to have
thought little the worse of them for their misfortune.
It is only fair to state that there is
some doubt as to whether Jeanne was sent in
command of the army, or the army in command
of Jeanne; indeed, all through her story it is
never easy to be certain whether she was actually
in command, and Anatole France looks upon her
as a sort of military <i>mascotte</i> rather than a soldier.
Nor has Anatole France ever been properly
answered. Andrew Lang did his best, as Don
Quixote did his best to fight the windmills, but
Mr. Lang was an idealist and romanticist, and
could not defeat the laughing irony of M. France.
Indeed, what answer is possible? Anatole France
does not laugh at the poor little Maid; he laughs
through her at modern French clericalism. Nobody
with a heart in his breast could laugh at
Jeanne d’Arc! Anatole France simply said that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
he did not believe the things which Mr. Lang
said that he believed; he would be a brave man
who should say that M. France is wrong.</p>

<p>When she reached Orleans a new spirit at once
came into the defenders, just as a new spirit
came into the British army on the Somme when
the tanks first went forth to battle—a spirit of
renewed hope; God had sent his Maid to save
the right! In nine days of mild fighting, in which
the French enormously outnumbered the English,
the siege was raised. The French lost a few score
men; the English army was practically destroyed.</p>

<p>Next Jeanne persuaded the Dauphin to be
crowned at Rheims, which was the ancient
crowning-place for the French kings. In this
ancient cathedral, in whose aisles and groined
vaults echoed the memories and glories of centuries,
he was crowned; his followers standing around
in a proud assembly, his adoring peasant-maid
holding her grotesque banner over his head;
probably the most extraordinary scene in all
history. After Jeanne had secured the crowning
of her king, ill-fortune was thenceforth to wait
upon her. She was of the common people, and
it was only about eighty years since the aristocracy
had shuddered before the herd during the
Jacquerie, the premonition of the Revolution of
1789. Class feeling ran strongly, and the nobles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
took their revenge; Jeanne, having no ability
whatever beyond her implicit faith in Heaven,
lost her influence both with the Court and with
the people; whatever she tried to do failed,
and she was finally captured in a sortie from
Compiêgne in circumstances which do not exclude
the suspicion that she was deliberately sacrificed.
The Burgundians held her for ransom, and locked
her up in the Tower of Beaurevoir. King Charles
VII refused—or at any rate neglected—to bid
for her; so the Burgundians sold her to the
English. When she heard that she was to be
given into the hands of her bitterest enemies she
was so troubled that she leaped from the tower, a
height of sixty or seventy feet, and was miraculously
saved from death by the aid of her friends—Saints
Margaret and Catherine. It is easier to
believe that at her early age—she was then about
nineteen or possibly even less—her epiphyseal
cartilages had not ossified, and if she fell on soft
ground it is perfectly credible that she might not
receive worse than a severe shock. I remember a
case of a child who fell from a height of thirty
feet on to hard concrete, which it struck with
its head; an hour later it was running joyfully
about the hospital garden, much to the disgust
of an anxious charge-nurse. It is difficult to kill
a young person by a fall—the bones and muscles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
yield to violent impact, and life is not destroyed.</p>

<p>Jeanne having been bought by the English they
brought her to trial before a court composed of
Pierre Cauchon, Lord Bishop of Beauvais, and a
varying number of clerics; as Anatole France
puts it, “a veritable synod”; it was important
to condemn not only the witch of the Armagnacs
herself but also the viper whom she had been able
to crown King of France. If they condemned
her for witchcraft they condemned all her works,
including King Charles. If Charles had been a
clever man he would have foreseen such a result
and would have bought her from the Duke of
Burgundy when he had the chance. But when
she was once in the iron grip of the English he
could have done nothing. It was too late. If
he had offered to buy her the English would have
said she was not for sale; if he had moved his
tired and disheartened army they would have
handed her over to the University of Paris, or
perhaps the dead body of one more peasant-girl
would have been found in the Seine below Rouen,
and Cauchon would have been spared the trouble
of a trial. Therefore we may spare our regrets
on the score of some at least of King Charles’s
ingratitudes. It is possible that he did not buy
her from the Burgundians because he was too
stupid, too poor, or too parsimonious; it is more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
likely that his courtiers and himself began to
believe that her success was so great that it could
not be explained by mortal means, and that there
must be something in the witchcraft story after
all. It could not have been a pleasant thing for
the French aristocrats to find that when a little
maid from Domremy came to help the common
people, these scum of the earth suddenly began
to fight as they had not fought for generations.
Fully to understand what happened we must
remember that it was not very long since the
Jacquerie, and that the aristocratic survivors had
left to their sons tales of unutterable horrors.</p>

<p>However, Jeanne was put on her trial for witchcraft,
and after a long and apparently hesitating
process—for there had been grave doubts raised
as to the legality of the whole thing—she was
condemned to death. Just before the Bishop had
finished his reading of the sentence she burst into
tears and recanted, when she really understood
that they were even then preparing the cart to
take her to the stake. She said herself, in words
which cannot possibly be misunderstood, that
she recanted “for fear of the fire.”</p>

<p>The sentence of the court was then amended;
instead of being burned she was to be held in
prison on bread and water and to wear woman’s
clothes. She herself thought that she was to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
put into an ecclesiastical prison and be kept in
the charge of women, but there is nothing to be
found of this in the official report of the first
trial. As she had been wearing men’s clothes by
direct command of God her sin in recanting began
to loom enormous before her during the night;
she had forsaken her God even as Peter had forsaken
Jesus Christ in the hour of his need, and
hell-fire would be her portion—a fire ten
thousand times worse than anything that the
executioner could devise for her. She got up
in the morning and threw aside the pretty dress
which the Duchess of Bedford had procured for
her—all women loved Jeanne d’Arc—and put
on her war-worn suit of male clothing. The
English soldiers who guarded her immediately
spread abroad the bruit that Jeanne had relapsed,
and she was brought to trial for this contumacious
offence against the Holy Church. The second trial
was short and to the point; she tried to show that
her jailers had not kept faith with her, but her
pleadings were brushed aside, and finally she gave
the <i>responsio mortifera</i>—the fatal answer—which
legalized the long attempts to murder her. Thus
spoke she: “God hath sent me word by St.
Catherine and St. Margaret of the great pity it
is, this treason to which I have consented to
abjure and save my life! I have damned myself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
to save my life! Before last Thursday my Voices
did indeed tell me what I should do and what I
did then on that day. When I was on the scaffold
on Thursday my Voices said to me: ‘Answer
him boldly, this preacher!’ And in truth he is a
false preacher; he reproached me with many
things I never did. If I said that God had not
sent me I should damn myself, for it is true that
God has sent me; my Voices have said to me since
Thursday: ‘Thou hast done great evil in declaring
that what thou hast done was wrong.’ All
I said and revoked I said for fear of the fire.”</p>

<p>To me this is the most poignant thing in the
whole trial, which I have read with a frightful
interest many times. It seems to bring home
the pathos of the poor struggling child, and her
blind faith in things which could not help her in
her hour of sore distress.</p>

<p>Jules Quicherat published a very complete
edition of the Trial in 1840, which has been the
basis for all the accounts of Jeanne d’Arc that
have appeared since. An English translation
was published some years ago which professed
to be complete and to omit nothing of importance.
But this work was edited in a fashion so
vehemently on Jeanne’s side, with no apparent
attempt to ascertain the exact truth of the judgments,
that I ventured to compare it with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
Quicherat, and I have found some omissions which
to the translator, as a layman, may have seemed
unimportant, but which, to a doctor, seem of
absolutely vital importance in considering
the truth about the Maid. These omissions
are marked in the English by a row of three dots,
which might be considered to mark an omission,—but
on the other hand might not. Probably
the translator considered them too indecent,
too earthly, too physiological, to be introduced
in connexion with the Maid of God. But Jeanne
had a body, which was subject to the same
peculiarities and abnormalities as the bodies of
other people; and upon the peculiarities of her
physiology depended the peculiarities of her mind.</p>

<p>Jean d’Aulon, her steward and loyal admirer,
said definitely in the Rehabilitation Trial, in
1456:—</p>

<p>“Qu’il oy dire a plusiers femmes, qui ladicte
Pucelle ont veue par plusiers foiz nues, et sceue
de ses secretz, que oncques n’avoit eu la secret
maladie de femmes et que jamais nul n’en peut
rien cognoistre ou appercevoir par ses habillements,
ne aultrement.”</p>

<p>I leave this unpleasantly frank statement in
the original Old French, merely remarking that it
means that Jeanne never menstruated. D’Aulon
must have had plenty of opportunities for knowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
this, in his position as steward of her household
in the field. He guards himself from innuendo
by saying that several women had told him.
Jeanne’s failing to become mature must have
been the topic of amazed conversation among all
the women of her neighbourhood, and no doubt
she herself took it as a sign from God that she
was to remain virgin. It is especially significant
that she first heard her Voices when she was about
thirteen years of age, at the very time that she
should have begun to menstruate; and that at
first they did not come regularly, but came at
intervals, just as menstruation itself often begins.
Some months later she was informed by the
Voices that she was to remain virgin, and thereby
would she save France, in accordance with a
prophecy that a woman should ruin France, and
a virgin should save it. Is it not probable that
the idea of virginity must have been growing in
her mind from the time when she first realized
that she was not to be as other women? Probably
the delusion as to the Voices first began as a sort
of vicarious menstruation; probably it recurred
when menstruation should have reappeared;
we can put the idea of virginity into the jargon
of psycho-analysis by saying that Jeanne had
well-marked “repression of the sex-complex.”
The mighty forces which should have manifested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
themselves in normal menstruation manifested
themselves in her furious religious zeal and her
Voices. Repression of the sex-complex is like
locking up a giant in a cellar; sooner or later he
may destroy the whole house. He ended by
driving Jeanne d’Arc to the stake. That was a
nobler fate than befalls some girls, whom the
same giant drives to the streets; nobler, because
Jeanne the peasant was of essentially noble stock.
Her mother was Isabel Romée—the “Romed
woman”—the woman who had had sufficient
religious fervour to make the long and dangerous
pilgrimage to Rome that she might acquire the
merit of seeing the Holy Father; Jeanne herself
made a still more dangerous pilgrimage, which has
won for her the love of mankind at the cost of her
bodily anguish. Madame her mother saved her
own soul by her pilgrimage, and bore an heroic
daughter; Jeanne saved France by her courage and
devotion to her idea of God. And this would
have been impossible had she not suffered from
repression of the sex-complex and seen visions
therefore.</p>

<p>Another remarkable piece of evidence has been
omitted from the English translation. It was given
by the Demoiselle Marguerite la Thoroulde, who
had taken Jeanne to the baths and seen her unclothed.
Madame la Thoroulde said, in the Latin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
translation of the Rehabilitation Trial which has
survived: “Quod cum pluries vidit in balneo et
stuphis [sweating-bath] et, ut percipere potuit,
credit ipse fore virginem.”</p>

<p>That is to say, she saw her naked in the baths
and could see that she was a virgin! What on
earth did the good lady think that a virgin would
look like? Did she think that because Jeanne
did not look like a stout French matron she
must therefore be a virgin? Or did she see a
strong and boyish form, with little development
of hips and bust, which she thought must be
nothing else but that of a virgin? That is the
explanation that occurs to me; and probably
it also explains Jeanne’s idea that by wearing men’s
clothes she would render herself less attractive to
the mediæval soldiery among whom her lot was
to be cast. An ordinary buxom young woman
would certainly not be less attractive because she
displayed her figure in doublet and hose; Rosalind
is none the less winsome when she acts the
boy; and I should have thought that Jeanne,
by wearing men’s clothes, would simply have
proclaimed to her male companions that she was
a very woman. But if the idea be correct that
she was shaped like a boy, with little feminine
development, the whole mystery is at once solved.
It is to be remembered that we know absolutely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
nothing about Jeanne’s appearance<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>; the only
credible hint we have is that she had a gentle voice.</p>

<p>In the Rehabilitation Trial several of her companions
in arms swore that she had had no sexual
attraction for them. It is quaint to read the
evidence of these respectable middle-aged gentlemen
that in their hot and lusty youth they had
once upon a time met at least one young girl
after whom they had not lusted; they seem to
consider that the fact proved that she must
have come from God. Anatole France makes
great play with them, but it would appear that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
his ingenuity is in this direction misplaced.
Is it not possible that Jeanne was unattractive to
men because she was immature—that she never
became more than a child in mind and body?
Even mediæval soldiery would not lust after a
child, especially a child whom they firmly believed
to have come straight from God! It must be
remembered that to half of her world Jeanne was
unspeakably sacred; to the other half she was
undeniably a most frightful witch. Even the
executioner would not imperil his immortal soul
by touching her. It was the custom to spare a
woman the anguish of the fire, by smothering
her, or rendering her unconscious by suddenly
compressing her carotids with a rope before the
flames leaped around her. But Jeanne was far
too wicked for anybody to touch in this merciful
office; they had to let her die unaided; and
afterwards, so wicked was her heart, they had to
rescue it from the ashes and throw it into the
Seine. Is it conceivable that men who thought
thus would have ventured hell-fire by making
love to her? Yet more—it is quite possible that
she had no bodily charms whatever; we know
nothing of her appearance. The story that she
was charming and beautiful is simply sentimental
legend. Indeed, it is difficult not to become
sentimental over Jeanne d’Arc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>A noteworthy feature in her character was her
Puritanism. She prohibited her soldiers from
consorting with the prostitutes that followed the
army; sometimes she even forced them to marry
these women. Naturally the soldiers objected
most strongly, and in the end this was one of
the causes that led to her downfall. Jeanne used
to run after the prohibited girls and strike them
with the flat of her sword; in one case the girl
was killed. In another the sword broke, and
King Charles asked, very sensibly, “Would not
a stick have done quite as well?” This is
believed by some people to have been the very
sword of Charles Martel which the priests had
found for her at St. Catherine’s command, and
naturally the soldiers, deprived of their female
companions, wondered what sort of a holy sword
could it have been which could not even stand
the smiting of a prostitute? When people
suffer from repression of the sex-complex the
trouble may show itself either by constant indirect
attempts to find favour in the eyes of individuals
of the opposite sex, or sometimes by actually
forbidding all sexual matters; Puritanism in
sexual affairs is often an indication that all is not
quite well with a woman’s subconscious mind;
nor can one confine this generalization to one
sex. It is not for one moment to be thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
that Jeanne ever had the slightest idea of what
was the matter with her; the whole of her delusions
and Puritanism were to her quite conscious
and real; the only thing that she did not know
was that her delusions were entirely subjective—that
her Voices had no existence outside her own
mind. Her frantic belief in them led her to an
heroic career and to the stake. She did not consciously
repress her sex; Nature did that for her.</p>

<p>Women who never menstruate are not uncommon;
most gynæcologists see a few. Though
they are sometimes normal in their sexual feelings—sometimes
indeed they are even nymphomaniacs
or very nearly so—yet they seldom marry, for they
know themselves to be sterile, and, after all, most
women seem to know at the bottom of their hearts
that the purpose of women is to produce children.</p>

<p>But there is still more of psychological interest
to be gained from a careful reading of the first
trial. It is possible to see how Jeanne’s unstable
nervous system reacted to the long agony. We
had better, in order to be fair, make quite certain
why she was burned. These are the words
uttered by the good Bishop of Beauvais as he
sentenced her for the last time:—</p>

<p>“Thou hast been on the subject of thy pretended
divine revelations and apparitions lying,
seducing, pernicious, presumptuous, lightly believing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
rash, superstitious, a divineress and
blasphemer towards God and the Saints, a despiser
of God Himself in His sacraments; a
prevaricator of the Divine Law, of sacred doctrine
and of ecclesiastical sanctions; seditious, cruel,
apostate, schismatic, erring on many points
of our Faith, and by these means rashly guilty
towards God and Holy Church.”</p>

<p>This appalling fulmination, summed up, appears
to mean—if it means anything—that she believed
that she was under the direct command of God
to wear man’s clothes. To this she could only
answer that what she had done she had done by
His direct orders.</p>

<p>Theologians have said that her answers at the
trial were so clever that they must have been
directly inspired; but it is difficult to see any
sign of such cleverness. To me her character
stands out absolutely clearly defined from the
very beginning of the six weeks’ agony; she is a
very simple, direct, and superstitious child struggling
vainly in the meshes of a net spread for
her by ecclesiastical politicians who were determined
to sacrifice her to serve the ends of brutal
masters. She had all a child’s simple cunning;
when the Bishop asked her to repeat her Paternoster
she answered that she would gladly do so
if he himself would confess her. She thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
that if he confessed her he might have pity on
her, or, at least, that he would be bound to send
her to Heaven, because she knew how great was
the influence wielded by a Bishop; she thought
that she might tempt him to hear her in the
secrets of the confessional if she promised to
repeat her Paternoster to him! Poor child—she
little knew what was at the bottom of the trial.</p>

<p>She sometimes childishly boasted. When she
was asked if she could sew, she answered that she
feared no woman in Rouen at the sewing; just
so might answer any immature girl of her years
to-day. She sometimes childishly threatened;
she told the Bishop that he was running a great
risk in charging her. She had delusions of sight,
smell, touch, and hearing. She said that the faces
of Saints Catherine and Margaret were adorned
with beautiful crowns, very rich and precious, that
the saints smelled with a sweet savour, that she
had kissed them, that they spoke to her.</p>

<p>There was a touch of epigram about the girl,
too. In speaking of her banner at Rheims, she
said: “It had been through the hardships—it
were well that it should share the glory.” And
again, when the judges asked her to what she
attributed her success, she answered, “I said to
my followers: ‘Go ye in boldly against the
English,’ <i>and I went myself</i>.” The girl who said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
that could hardly have been a mere military
<i>mascotte</i>. Yet, in admitting so much, one does
not admit that she may have been a sort of Amazon.
As the desperation of her position grew
upon her she began to suffer more and more from
her delusions; while she lay in her dungeon
waiting for the fatal cart she told a young friar,
Brother Martin Ladvenu, that her spirits came
to her in great numbers and of the smallest size.
When despair finally seized upon her she told
“the venerable and discreet Maître Pierre
Maurice, Professor of Theology,” that the angels
really had appeared to her—good or bad, they
really had appeared—in the form of very minute
things<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>; that she now knew that they had deceived
her. Her brain wearied by her long trial of
strength with the Bishop, common sense re-asserted
its sway, and she realized—the truth! Too late!
When she was listening to her sermon on the scaffold
in front of the fuel destined to consume her, she
broke down and knelt at the preacher’s knees, weeping
and praying until the English soldiers called
out to ask if she meant to keep them there for their
dinner; it is pleasing to know that one of them
broke his lance into two pieces, which he tied into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
the form of a cross and held it up to her in the
smoke that was already beginning to arise about her.</p>

<p>Her last thoughts we can never know; her last
word was the blessed name of Jesus, which she
repeated several times. In public—though she
had told Pierre Maurice in private that she had
“learned to know that her spirits had deceived
her”—she always maintained that she had both
seen and believed them because they came from
God; her courage was amazing, both physical
and moral. She was twice wounded, but she
said that she always carried her standard so that
she would never have to kill anybody—and that
in truth she had never killed anybody.</p>

<p>Her extraordinary accomplishment was due to
the unbounded superstition of the French common
people, who at first believed in her implicitly;
it was Napoleon, a French general, who said that
in war the moral is to the spiritual as three is
to one; our Lord said, “By faith ye shall move
mountains”; and it must not be forgotten that
she went to Orleans with powerful reinforcements
which she herself estimated at about ten to twelve
thousand men. This superstition of the French
was more than equalled by the superstition of
the English, who looked upon her as a most
terrifying witch: one witness at the Rehabilitation
Trial said that the English were a very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
superstitious nation, so they must have been
pretty bad. Indeed, most of the witnesses at
that trial seem to have been very superstitious;
one must examine their evidence with care lest one
suddenly finds that one is assisting at a miracle.</p>

<p>She seems to have been hot-tempered and
emphatic in her speech, with a certain tang of
rough humour such as would be natural in a
peasant girl. A notary once questioned the truth
of something she said at her trial; on inquiry it
was found that she had been perfectly accurate;
Jeanne “rejoiced, saying to Boisguillaume that
if he made mistakes again she would pull his
ears.” Once during the trial she was taken ill
with vomiting, apparently caused by fish-poisoning,
that followed after she had eaten of some
carp sent her by the Bishop. Maître d’Estivet,
the promoter of the trial, said to her, ‘Thou
<i>paillarde</i>!’ (an abusive term), ‘thou hast been
eating sprats and other unwholesomeness!’ She
answered that she had not; and then she and
d’Estivet exchanged many abusive words. The
two doctors of medicine who treated her for this
illness gave evidence, and it is pleasing to see
that they seem to have been able to rationalize
a trifle more about her than most of her contemporaries.
But, taken all through, her evidence
gives the impression of being exceedingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
simple and straightforward—just the sort of
thing to be expected from a child.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that a great many witnesses
at the Rehabilitation Trial swore that she was
“simple.” Did they mean that she was half-witted?
Probably not. More probably it was
true that she always wanted to spare her enemies,
when, in accordance with the custom of the Hundred
Years’ War, she should rather have held them
for ransom if they had been noble or slain them
if they had been poor men. To the ordinary brutal
mediæval soldiery such conduct would appear insane.
Possibly, of course, the term “simple” might
have been used in opposition to the term “gentle.”</p>

<p>May I be allowed to give a vignette of Jeanne
going to the burning, compiled from the evidence
of many onlookers given at the Rehabilitation
Trial? She assumed no martyresque imperturbability;
she did not hold her head high in the
haughty belief that she was right and the rest
of the world wrong, as a martyr should properly
do. She wept bitterly as she walked to the fatal
cart from the prison-doors; her head was
shaven; she wore woman’s dress; her face was
swollen and distorted, her eyes ran tears, her sobs
shook her body, her wails moved the hearts of
the onlookers. The French wept for sympathy,
the English laughed for joy. It was a very human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
child who went to her death on May 30th, 1431.
She was nineteen years of age—according to
some accounts, twenty-one—and, unknown to
herself, she had changed the face of history.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">The Empress Theodora</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THIS famous woman has been the subject
of one of the bitterest controversies in
history; and, while it is impossible to speak
fully about her, it is certain that she was a woman
of remarkable beauty, character, and historical
position. For nearly a thousand years after her
death she was looked upon as an ordinary—if unusually
able—Byzantine princess, wife of Justinian
the lawgiver, who was one of the ablest of the later
Roman Emperors; but in 1623 the manuscript was
discovered in the Vatican of a secret history,
purporting to have been written by Procopius,
which threw a new and amazing light on her career.</p>

<p>Procopius—or whoever wrote this most scurrilous
history—states that the great Empress
in early youth was an actress, daughter of a
bear-keeper, and that she had sold tickets in the
theatre; her youth had been disgustingly profligate:
he narrates a series of stories concerning
her which cannot be printed in modern English.
The worst of these go to show that she was an
ordinary type of Oriental prostitute, to whom
the word “unnatural,” as applied to vice, had
no meaning. The least discreditable is that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
girl who was to be Empress had danced nearly
naked on the stage—she is not the only girl
who has done this, and not on the stage either.
She had not even the distinction of being a
good dancer, but acquired fame through the wild
abandon and indecency with which she performed.
At about the age of twenty she married—when
she had already had a son—the grave and stately
Justinian: “the man who had never been
young,” who was so great and learned that it
was well known that he could be seen of nights
walking about the streets carrying his head in a
tray like John the Baptist. When he fell a victim
to Theodora’s wiles he was about forty years of
age. The marriage was bitterly opposed by
his mother and aunts, but they are said to have
relented when they met her, and even had a
special law passed to legalize the marriage of
the heir to the throne with a woman of ignoble
birth; and, after the death of Justin, Theodora
duly succeeded to the leadership of the proudest
court in Europe. This may be true; but it
does not sound like the actions of a mother and
old aunts. One would have thought that a
convenient bowstring or sack in the Bosphorus
would have been the more usual course.</p>

<p>So far we have nothing to go by but the statements
of one man; the greatest historian of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
his time, to be sure—if we can be certain that
he wrote the book. Von Ranke, himself a very
great critical historian, says flatly that Procopius
never wrote it; that it is simply a collection of
dirty stories current about other women long
afterwards. The Roman Empire seems to have
been a great hotbed for filthy tales about the
Imperial despots: one has only to remember
Suetonius, from whose lively pages most of our
doubtless erroneous views concerning the Palatine
“goings on” are derived; and to recall the foul
stories told about Julius Cæsar himself, who was
probably no worse than the average young officer
of his time; and of the last years of Tiberius,
who was probably a great deal better than the
average. Those of us who can cast their memories
back for a few years can doubtless recall an instance
of scurrilous libel upon a great personage of the
British Empire, which cast discredit not on the
gentleman libelled but upon the rascal who
spread the libel abroad. It is one of the penalties
of Empire that the wearer of the Imperial crown
must always be the subject of libels against
which he has no protection but in the loyal
friendship of his subjects. Even Queen Victoria
was once called “Mrs. Melbourne,” though
probably even the fanatic who howled it did not
believe that there was any truth in his insinuation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
And Procopius did not have the courage to
publish his libels, but preferred to leave to
posterity the task of finding out how dirty was
Procopius’ mind. Probably he would not have
lived very long had Theodora discovered what he
really thought of her. He was wise in his generation,
and had ever the example of blind Belisarius
before him to teach him to walk cautiously.</p>

<p>Démidour in 1887, Mallet in 1889, and Bury
also in 1889, have once more reviewed the evidence.
The two first-mentioned go very fully
into it, and sum up gallantly in Theodora’s
favour; but Bury is not so sure. Gibbon, having
duly warned us of Procopius’ malignity, proceeds
slyly to tell some of the most printable of the
indecent stories. Gibbon is seldom very far
wrong in his judgments, and evidently had very
little doubt in his own mind about Theodora’s
guilt. Joseph Maccabe goes over it all again,
and “regretfully” believes everything bad about
her. Edward Foord says, in effect, that supposing
the stories were all true, which he does not
appear to believe, and that she had thrown her
cap over the windmills when she was a girl—well,
she more than made up for it all when she
became Empress. After all, it depends upon
how far we can believe Procopius; and that
again depends upon how far we can bring ourselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
to believe that an exceedingly pretty little
Empress can once upon a time have been a <i>fille de
joie</i>. That in its turn depends upon how far each
individual man is susceptible to female beauty.
If she had been a prostitute it makes her career
as Empress almost miraculous; it is the most
extraordinary instance on record of “living a
thing down,” and speaks volumes for her charm
and strength of personality.</p>

<p>She lived in the midst of most furious theological
strife. Christianity was still a comparatively
new religion, even if we accept the
traditional chronology of the early world; and
in her time the experts had not yet settled what
were its tenets. The only thing that was perfectly
clear to each theological expert was that
if you did not agree with his own particular
belief you were eternally damned, and that it was
his duty to put you out of your sin immediately
by cutting your throat lest you should inveigle
some other foolish fellows into the broad path
that leadeth to destruction. Theodora was a
Monophysite—that is to say, she believed that
Christ had only one soul, whereas it was well
known to the experts that He had two. Nothing
could be too dreadful for the miscreants who
believed otherwise. It was gleefully narrated
how Nestorius, who had started the abominable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
doctrine of Monophysm, had his tongue eaten
by worms—that is, died of cancer of the tongue;
and it is not incredible that Procopius, who was a
Synodist or Orthodox believer, may have invented
the libels and secretly written them down in order
to show the world of after days what sort of
monster his heretical Empress really was, wear
she never so many gorgeous ropes of pearls in her
Imperial panoply. It is difficult to place any
bounds to theological hatred—or to human
credulity for that matter. The whole question
of the nature of Christ was settled by the Sixth
Œcumenical Council about a hundred and fifty
years later, when it was finally decided that
Christ had two natures, or souls, or wills—however
we interpret the Greek word Φύσις—each
separate and indivisible in one body. This, and
the Holy Trinity, are still, I understand, part
of Christian theology, and appear to be equally
comprehensible to the ordinary scientific man.</p>

<p>But it is difficult to get over a tradition of the
eleventh century—that is to say, six hundred
years before Procopius’ <i>Annals</i> saw the light—that
Justinian married “Theodora of the
Brothel.” Although Mallet showed that Procopius
had strong personal reasons for libelling
his Empress, one cannot help feeling that there
must be something in the stories after all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>Once she had assumed the marvellous crown,
with its ropes of pearls, in which she and many
of the other Empresses are depicted, her whole
character is said to have changed. Though her
enemies accused her of cruelty, greed, treachery,
and dishonesty—and no accounts from her friends
have survived—yet they were forced to admit
that she acted with propriety and amazing
courage; and no word was spoken against her
virtue. In the Nika riots, which at one time
threatened to depose Justinian, she saved the
Empire. Justinian, his ministers, and even the
hero Belisarius, were for flight, the mob howling
in the square outside the Palace, when Theodora
spoke up in gallant words which I paraphrase.
She began by saying how indecorous it was for
a woman to interfere in matters of State, and then
went on to say: “We must all die some time,
but it is a terrible thing to have been an Emperor
and to give up Empire before one dies. The
purple is a noble winding-sheet! Flight is easy,
my Emperor—there are the steps of the quay—there
are the ships waiting for you; you have
money to live on. But in very shame you will
taste the bitterness of death in life if you flee!
I, your wife, will not flee, but will stay behind
without you, and will die an Empress rather
than live a coward!” Proud little woman—could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
that woman have been a prostitute selling
her body in degradation? It seems impossible.</p>

<p>The Council, regaining courage, decided for
fighting; armed bands were sent forth into the
square; the riot was suppressed with Oriental ferocity;
and the Roman Empire lasted nearly a thousand
years more. “Toujours l’audace,” as Danton
said nearly thirteen hundred years later, when,
however, he was not in imminent peril himself.</p>

THE EMPRESS THEODORA.<br />

From a Mosaic (Ravenna, San Vitale).</p>

<p>In person Theodora was small, slender, graceful,
and exquisitely beautiful; her complexion was
pale, her eyes singularly expressive: the mosaic
at Ravenna, in stiff and formal art, gives some
evidence of character and beauty. She was
accused, as I have said, of barbarous cruelties, of
herself applying the torture in her underground
private prisons; the stories are contradictory
and inconsistent, but one story appears to be
historical: “If you do not obey me I swear
by the living God that I will have you flayed
alive,” she said with gentle grace to her attendants.
It is said that her illegitimate son, whom
she had disposed of by putting him with his terrified
father in Arabia, gained possession of the
secret of his birth, and boldly repaired to Constantinople
in the belief that her maternal
affection would lead her to pardon him for the
offence of having been born, and that thereby<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
he would attain to riches and greatness; but
the story goes that he was never seen again after
he entered the Palace. Possibly the story is of
the nature of romance. She dearly longed for a
legitimate son, and the faithful united in prayer
to that end; but the sole fruit of her marriage
was a daughter, and even this girl was said to have
been conceived before the wedding.</p>

<p>When she was still adolescent she went for a
tour in the Levant with a wealthy Tyrian named
Ecebolus, who, disgusted by her violent temper
or her universal <i>charity</i>, to use Gibbon’s sly
phrase, deserted her and left her penniless at
Alexandria. The men of Egypt appear to have
been less erotic than the Greeks, for she remained
in dire poverty, working her way back home by
way of the shores of the Euxine. In Egypt she
had become a Monophysite; and when she
reached Constantinople it is said that she sat
in a pleasant home outside the Palace and plied
her spinning-wheel so virtuously that Justinian
fell in love with her and ultimately married her,
having first tried her charms. Passing over the
obvious difficulty that a girl of the charm and
immorality of Procopius’ Theodora need never
have gone in poverty while men were men, the
wonder naturally arises whether the girl who
went away with Ecebolus was the same as she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
who returned poor and alone and sat so virtuously
at her spinning-wheel as to bewitch
Justinian. Mistaken identity, or rather loss of
identity, must have been commoner in those
days than these when the printing-press and
rapid postal and telegraphic communication
make it harder to lose one’s self. However,
granting that there was no confusion of identity,
one may believe—if one tries hard enough—that
she was befriended by the Monophysites in
Egypt, and may have “found religion” at their
hands, and, by suffering poverty and oppression
with them, had learned to sympathize with the
under-world. Though the story may seem to
be more suitable for an American picture-show
than for sober history, still one must admit that
it is not absolutely impossible. When she became
great and famous she did not forget those
who had rescued her in the days of her affliction;
and her influence on Justinian is to be seen in
the “feminism” which is so marked in his code.
What makes it not impossible is the well-known
fact that violent sexuality is in some way related
to powerful religious instincts; and the theory
that the passions which had led Theodora to the
brothel may, when her mind was turned to religion,
have led her to be a Puritan, is rather attractive.
But nothing is said about Theodora which has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
not in some way been twisted to her infamy.
The only certain fact about her is that
she had enormous influence over her husband,
and it is difficult to believe that a great and able
man like Justinian could have entirely yielded
his will to the will of a cruel and treacherous
harlot. The idea certainly opens an unexpectedly
wide vista of masculine weakness.</p>

<p>She used this influence in helping to frame the
great Code of Justinian, which has remained the
standard of law in many countries ever since. A
remarkable feature about this code is that, while
it is severe on the keepers of brothels, it is mild
to leniency on the unhappy women who prostituted
themselves for these keepers’ benefit.
The idea that a prostitute is a woman, with
rights and feelings like any other woman, appears
to have been unknown until Theodora had it
introduced into the code of laws which perpetuates
her husband’s memory. One night
she collected all the prostitutes in Constantinople,
five hundred in all—were there only five
hundred in that vast Oriental city?—shut them
up in a palace on the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus,
and expected them to reform as she had
reformed, but with less success; as our modern
experience would lead us to expect. The girls
grew morbidly unhappy, and many threw themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
into the sea. Even in a lock hospital we
know how difficult it is to reclaim girls to whom
sexual intercourse has become a matter of daily
habit, and if Theodora’s well-meant attempt
failed we must at least give her credit for an
attempt at an idealistic impossibility. These
girls did not have the prospect of marrying an
Emperor; no pearl-stringed crown was dangled
before their fingers for the grasping. Poor
human nature is not so easily kept on the strait
and narrow path as Theodora thought. Throughout
her life she seems to have had great sympathy
for the poor and the oppressed, and one feels
with Edward Foord that one can forgive her a
great deal. We must not forget that her husband
called her his “honoured wife,” his “gift from
God,” and his “sweet delight”; and spoke
most gratefully of her interest and assistance
in framing his great code of laws. Was her
humanitarianism, her sympathy with down-trodden
women, the result of her own sad past
experience? To think so would be to turn her
pity towards vice into an argument against her
own virtue, and I shrink from doing so. Let
us rather believe that she really did perceive
how terribly the Fates have loaded the dice
against women, and that she did what she
could to make their paths easier through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
this earth on which we have no continuing city.</p>

<p>Her health gave her a great deal of trouble,
and she spent many months of every year in her
beautiful villas on the shores of the Sea of Marmora
and the Bosphorus. She remained in
bed most of every day, rising late, and retiring
early. To Procopius and the Synodists these
habits were naturally signs of Oriental weakness
and luxury; but may not the poor lady have
been really ill? She visited several famous
baths in search of health, and we have a vivid
account of her journey through Bithynia on her
way to the hot springs of the Pythian Apollo
near Brusa.</p>

<p>We have no evidence as to the nature of her
illness. Her early life, of course, suggests some
venereal trouble, and it is interesting to inquire
into the position of the various venereal diseases
at that time. Syphilis I think we may rule out
of court; for it is now generally believed that
that disease was not known in Europe until
after the return of Columbus’ men from the
West Indian islands. Some of the bones of
Egypt were thought to show signs of syphilitic
invasion until it was shown by Elliott Smith
that similar markings are caused by insects;
and no indubitable syphilitic lesion has ever been
found in any of the mummies. If syphilis did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
really occur in European antiquity, it must have
been exceedingly rare and have differed widely
in its pathological effects from the disease which
is so common and destructive to-day; that is
to say, in spite of certain German enthusiasts, it
could not have been syphilis.</p>

<p>But gonorrhœa is a very old story, and was
undoubtedly prevalent in the ancient world.
Luys indeed says that gonorrhœa is as old as
mankind, and was named by Galen himself,
though regular physicians and surgeons scorned
to treat it. It is strange that there is so little
reference to this disease in the vast amount of
pornographic literature which has come down to
us. Martial, for instance, or Ovid; nothing
would seem too obscene to have passed by their
salacious minds; yet neither of them so much
as hint that such a thing as gonorrhœa existed.
But it is possible that such a disease might have
been among the things unlucky or “tabu.”
All nations and all ages have been more or less
under the influence of tabu, which ranges from
influence on the most trivial matters to settlement
of the gravest. Thus, many men would
almost rather die than walk abroad in a frock
coat and tan boots, or, still more dreadful, in a
frock coat and Homburg hat, though that
freakish costume appears to be common enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
in America. In this matter we are under the
influence of tabu—the thing which prevents us,
or should prevent us, from eating peas with our
knife, or making unseemly noises when we eat
soup, or playing a funeral march at a cheerful
social gathering. In all these things the idea of
<i>nefas</i>—unlucky—seems more or less to enter;
similarly we do not like to walk under a ladder
lest a paint-pot should fall upon us. Many people
hate to mention the dread word “death,” lest
that should untimely be their portion. Just so
possibly a licentious man like Ovid may have
been swayed by some such fear, and he may have
refrained from writing about the horrid disease
which he must have known was ever waiting for
him.</p>

<p>But though it may seem to have been impossible
that any prostitute should have escaped gonorrhœa
in Byzantium, just as it is impossible in modern
London or Sydney, yet there is no evidence that
Theodora so suffered; what hints we have, if
they weigh on either side at all, seem to make
it unlikely. She had a child after her marriage
with Justinian, though women who have had
untreated gonorrhœa are very frequently or
generally sterile. Nor is there any evidence
that Justinian ever had any serious illness except
the bubonic plague, from which he suffered, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
recovered, during the great epidemic of 546.
I assume that the buboes from which he doubtless
suffered at that time were not venereal but
were the ordinary buboes of plague. He had
been Theodora’s husband for many years before
that terrible year in which the plague swept away
about a third of the population of the Roman
Empire, where it had been simmering ever
since the time of Marcus Aurelius. If Theodora
really had gonorrhœa, Justinian must have caught
it, and it is unlikely that he would have called
her his “honoured wife.”</p>

<p>A more probable explanation of her continued
ill-health might be that she became septic at her
confinement, when the unwanted girl was born.
When the Byzantines spoke of a child as being
“born in the purple,” they spoke literally, for
the Roman Empress was always sent to a “porphyry
palace” on the Bosphorus for her confinement;
and once there she had access to less good
treatment than is available for any sempstress
to-day. It is impossible to suppose that the
porphyry palace—the “purple house”—ever
became infected with puerperal sepsis because
there was never more than one confinement
going on at a time within its walls, and that only
at long intervals. Still, there must have been
a great many septic confinements and unrecorded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
female misery from their results among the
women of that early world; and that must be
remembered when we consider the extraordinarily
small birth-rate of the Imperial families during
so many centuries. Had the Roman Emperors
been able to point to strong sons to inherit their
glories, possibly the history of the Empire would
have been less turbulent. A Greek or Roman
Lister might have altered the history of the world
by giving security of succession to the Imperial
despot.</p>

<p>After all, it is idle to speculate on Theodora’s
illness, and it does not much matter. She has
long gone to her account, poor fascinating
creature; all her beauty and wit and eager
vivacity are as though they had never been save
for their influence upon her husband’s laws.
Theodora is the standing example of woman’s
fate to achieve results through the agency of
some man.</p>

<p>She died of cancer, and died young. There
is no record of the original site of the cancer;
the ecclesiastic who records the glad tidings
merely relates joyfully that it was diffused
throughout her body, as was only right and proper
in one who differed from him in religious opinions.
It is generally thought that it started in the
breast. No doubt this is a modern guess, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
of course cancer of the breast is notorious for
the way in which its secondary growths spread
through liver, lungs, bones, neck, spine, and so
forth; and there is little reason to suppose that
the guess is incorrect. After trying all the usual
remedies for “lumps,” her physicians determined
to send her to the baths of Brusa, famous
in miraculous cure. There were two large iron
and two large sulphur springs, besides smaller
ones; and people generally went there in spring
and early summer when the earth was gaily
carpeted with the myriad flowers that spring up
and fade before the heat of the Mediterranean
July. May we infer from the choice of a sulphur
bath that the cancer had already invaded the
skin? Possibly. Such a horror may have been
the determining factor which induced the Empress
and her physicians to travel afield. But if so,
surely the recording priest missed a chance of
rejoicing; for he does not tell us the glad news.
All over Bithynia and the Troad there were,
and are, hot mineral springs; Homer relates
how one hot spring and a cold gushed from
beneath the walls of Troy itself. The girls of
Troy used to wash their clothes in the hot spring
whenever Agamemnon would let them.</p>

<p>When Theodora went to Brusa she was accompanied
by a retinue of four thousand, and Heaven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
resounded with the prayers of the Monophysites;
but the Orthodox refused to pray for the recovery
of so infamous a heretic, just as they had refused
to join in her prayers for a son. Theodora met
with little loving-kindness on this earth after she
had left Egypt; possibly the world repaid her
with what it received from her.</p>

<p>The sanctuaries of Asklepios were the great
centres of Greek and Roman healing, and the
treatment there was both mental and physical.
The temples were generally built in charming
localities, where everything was peace and loveliness;
the patients lay in beds in beautiful
colonnades, and to them, last thing at night,
priests delivered restful and touching services;
when sleep came upon them they dreamt, and
the dreams were looked upon as the voice of
God; they followed His instructions and were
cured. They were not cured, however, if they
had cancer. One Ælius Aristides has left us a
vivid—and unconsciously amusing—account of
his adventures in search of health; he seems to
have been a neurotic man who ultimately developed
into a first-class neurasthenic. To him
his beloved god was indeed a trial, as no doubt
Aristides himself was to his more earthly physicians.
He would sit surrounded by his friends,
to whom he would pour out his woes in true<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
neurasthenic style. Aristides seems never to
have been truly happy unless he was talking
about his ailments, and he loyally followed any
suggestion for treatment if only he could persuade
himself that it came from the beloved Asklepios.
The god would send him a vision, that ordered
him to bathe three times in icy water when
fevered, and afterwards to run a mile in the teeth
of a north-east wind—and the north-easters in
the Troad can be bitter indeed; very different
from the urbane and gentle breath that spreads
so delicious a languor over the summer of Sydney!
This behest the much-tried man of faith would
dutifully perform, accompanied by a running
bodyguard of doctors and nurses marvelling at
his endurance and the inscrutable wisdom of the
god, though they expected, and no doubt in
their inmost hearts hoped, that their long-suffering
patient would drop dead from exhaustion.
There were real doctors at these
shrines besides priests. The doctors seem to
have been much the same kind of inquisitive
and benevolent persons as we are to-day; some
of them were paid to attend the poor without
fee. The nurses were both male and female,
and appear to have been most immoral people.
Aristides was the wonder of his age; his fame
spread from land to land, and it is marvellous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
that he neither succumbed to his heroic treatment
nor lost his faith in the divine being that
subjected him to such torment. Both facts
are perhaps characteristic of mankind. The
manner of his end I do not know.</p>

<p>In Theodora’s time Asklepios and the other
Olympian divinities had long been gathered
to their fathers before the advancing tides of
Christianity and Earth-Mother worship; but
though the old gods were gone the human body
and human spirit remained the same, and there
is no doubt that she was expected to dream and
bathe and drink mineral waters just as Aristides
had done centuries before; and no doubt a crowd
of sympathizing friends sat round her on the
marble seats which are still there and tried to
console her—a difficult task when the sufferer
has cancer of the breast. She sat there, her
beauty faded, her once-rounded cheeks ashy with
cachexia and lined with misery, brooding over
the real nature of the Christ she was so soon
to meet, wondering whether she or her implacable
enemies were in the right as to His soul—whether
He had in truth two souls or one. She had made
her choice, and it was too late now to alter; in
any case she was too gallant a little Empress to
quail in the face of death, come he never so
horribly. Let us hope that she had discovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
before she died that Christ the All-merciful
would forgive even so atrocious a sin as attributing
to Him a single soul! All her piety, all
the prayers of her friends, and all the medical
skill of Brusa proved in vain, and she died in
<span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 548, being then forty years of age. So we
take leave of this woman, whom many consider
the most remarkable in history. Let us envisage
her to ourselves—this graceful, exquisite, little
cameo-faced lady, passionate in her loves and
her hates, with some of the languor of the East
in her blood, much of the tigress; brave in
danger and resourceful in time of trouble;
loyal and faithful to her learned husband as he
was loyal to her; yet perhaps a little despising
him. Except Medea, as seen by Euripides,
Theodora was probably the first feminist, and as
such has made her mark upon the world. On
the whole her influence upon the Roman Empire
seems to have been for good, and the merciful
and juster trend of the laws she inspired must
be noted in her favour.</p>

<p>Theodora dead, the glory of Justinian departed.
He seemed to be stunned by the calamity, and
for many critical months took no part in the
world’s affairs; even after he recovered he
seemed but the shadow of his old self. Faithful
to her in life, he remained faithful after her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
death, and sought no other woman; that is
another reason for thinking that Procopius lied.
He lived, a lonely and friendless old man, for
eighteen more years, hated by his subjects for
his extortionate taxation—which they attributed
to the extravagance of the crowned prostitute,
though more likely it was due to the enormous
campaigns of Belisarius and Narses the eunuch,
as a result of which Italy and Africa once more
came under the sway of the East. Justinian
was lonely on his death-bed, and the world
breathed a sigh of relief when he was gone. He
had long outlived his glory.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">The Emperor Charles V</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THAT extraordinary phenomenon which,
being neither Holy, nor Roman, nor yet
strictly speaking an Empire, was yet called the
Holy Roman Empire, began when Charlemagne
crossed the Alps to rescue the reigning Pope from
the Lombards in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 800. The Pope crowned
him Roman Emperor of the West, a title which
had been extinct since the time of Odoacer more
than three hundred years before. The revival
of the resplendent title caused the unhappy
people of the Dark Ages to think for a moment
in their misery that the mighty days of Augustus
and Marcus Aurelius had returned; it seemed to
add the power of God to the romance of ages
and the brute power of kings. During the next
two centuries the peoples of France and Germany
gradually evolved into two separate nations, but
it was impossible for men to forget the great
brooding power which had given the <i>Pax Romana</i>
to the world, and its hallowed memory survived
more beneficent than possibly it really was; it
appeared to their imaginations that if it were
possible to unite the sanctity of the Pope with
the organizing power of Rome the blessed times<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
might again return when a man might reap in
peace what he had sown in peace, and the long
agony of the Dark Ages might be lifted from
mankind. When Henry the Fowler had welded
the Germans into a people with a powerful king
the time appeared to have arisen, and his son
Otto was crowned Holy Roman Emperor. He
was not Emperor of Germany, nor German
Emperor; he was <i>Holy Roman Emperor</i> of the
German people, wielding power, partly derived
from the religious power of the Pope, and partly
from the military resources of whatever fiefs he
might hold; and this enormous and loosely knit
organization persisted until 1806—nearly seven
hundred years from the time of Otto, and more
than 1,000 years after the time of Charlemagne.</p>

<p>This mediæval Roman Empire was founded on
sentiment; it took its power from blessed—and
probably distorted—memories of a golden age,
when one mighty Imperator really did rule the
civilized world with a strong and autocratic hand.
It was a pathetic attempt to put back the hands
of the clock. It bespoke the misery through
which mankind was passing in the attempt to
combine feudalism with justice. When the
mediæval Emperor was not fighting with the Pope
he was generally fighting with his presumed subjects;
occasionally he tried to defend Europe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
from the Turks. He might have justified his
existence by defending Constantinople in 1453,
by which he would have averted the greatest
disaster that has ever befallen Europe. He
missed that opportunity, and the mediæval
Empire, though it survived that extraordinary
calamity, yet continued ramshackle, feeble, and
mediævally glorious until long past the Protestant
Reformation. Being Roman, of course it was
anti-Lutheran, and devoted its lumbering energies
to the destruction of the Protestants. No Holy
Roman Emperor ever rivalled the greatness of
Charles V, in whose frame shone all the romance
and glamour of centuries. How vast was his
power is shown when we consider that he ruled
over the Netherlands, Burgundy, Spain, Austria,
much of what is now Germany, and Italy; and
he was not a man to be contented with a nominal
rule.</p>

<p>He was born in Ghent in 1500 to Philip, Duke
of Burgundy, and Juana, who is commonly known
as “Crazy Jane”; it is now generally believed
that she was insane, though the Spaniards shrank
from imputing insanity to a queen. From his
father he inherited the principalities of the
Netherlands and Burgundy; from his mother he
inherited the kingships of Spain, Naples, and the
Spanish colonies. When his grandfather, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
Hapsburg Emperor Maximilian, died, Charles
was elected Emperor in 1519; the other candidate
was Francis I of France. The electors were the
seven <i>Kurfursten</i> of Germany, and Charles
bribed the harder of the two. What power on
earth could summon before a magistrate the
kings of France and Spain on a charge of improperly
influencing the vote of a German
princelet? Once having attained to the title
of Roman Emperor, added to the enormous
military power of King of Spain, Charles immediately
became the greatest man in the world.
He was strong, cautious, athletic, brave, and
immeasurably sagacious; his reputation for wisdom
long survived him.</p>

<p>Francis did not forgive him his victory, and
for the next quarter of a century—until 1544—Europe
resounded with the rival cries of the two
monarchs, unhappy Italy being usually the actual
scene of battle. At Pavia in 1525 Francis had
to say “All is lost save honour”—the precise
definition of “honour” in Francis’s mind being
something very different from what it is to-day.
Francis was captured and haled to Madrid to
meet his grim conqueror, who kept him in prison
until he consented to marry Charles’s favourite
sister Eleanor of Austria, and to join with him
in an alliance against the heretics. This Eleanor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
was a gentle and beautiful lady whom Charles
treated with true brotherly contempt; yet she
loved him. As soon as Francis was out of prison
he forgot that he was married, and made love to
every pretty girl that came his way.</p>

<p>Francis being safely out of the way, Charles
turned to the great aim of his life—to reconcile
Protestants with Catholics throughout his colossal
Empire. He was a strong Catholic, and displayed
immense energy in the reconciliation.
According to Gibbon, who quotes the learned
Grotius,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> he burned 100,000 Netherlanders, and
Gibbon dolefully remarks that this one Holy
Roman Emperor slew more Christians than all
the pagan Roman Emperors put together. Charles
appears to have grown gradually into the habit of
persecution; he began comparatively mildly, and
it was not till 1550 that he began to see that there
was really nothing else to do with these dull and
obstinate Lutherans but to burn them. He
could not understand it. He was sure he was
right, and yet the more Netherlanders he burned
the fewer seemed to attend mass. Moreover, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
was impossible to believe that those things the
miscreant Luther had said about the immoral
conduct of the monks could be true; once upon a
time he had met the fellow, and had him in his
power; why had he not burned him once and for
all and saved the world from this miserable
holocaust which had now become necessary
through the man’s pestilential teaching? So
Charles went on with his conciliation, driven by
conscience—the most terrible spur that can be
applied to the flanks of a righteous man. No
doubt Torquemada acted from conscience, and
Robespierre; possibly even Nero could have
raked up some sort of a conscientious motive for
all he did—the love of pure art, perhaps. “<i>Qualis
artifex pereo!</i>” said he in one of those terse
untranslatable Latin phrases when he was
summoning up his courage to fall upon his sword
in the high Roman manner; surely there spoke
the artist: “How artistically I die!”</p>

<p>The activities of Charles were so enormous
that it is impossible in this short sketch even to
mention them all. Besides his conquest of
Francis and, through him, Italy, he saved Europe
from the Turk. To Francis’s eternal dishonour
he had made an alliance with the last great Turkish
Sultan, Solyman the Magnificent. The baleful
power which had conquered Constantinople less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
than a century before seemed to be sweeping on
to spread its abominations over Western Europe;
and history finds it difficult to forgive Francis
for assisting its latest conqueror. Men remembered
how Constantine Palæologus had fallen
amidst smoke and carnage in his empurpled
blazonry, heroic to the last; they forgot that the
destruction of 1453 was probably the direct
result of the Venetian and French attack under
Dandolo in 1204, from which Constantinople
never recovered. In talking of the “Terrible
Turk” they forgot that Dandolo and his Venetians
and Frenchmen had committed atrocities
quite as terrible as the Turks’ during those days
and nights when Constantinople was given over
to rapine; and now the brilliant Francis appeared
to be carrying on Dandolo’s war against civilization.
So when Charles stepped forward as
the great hero of Europe, and drove the Turks
down the Danube with an army under his own
leadership he was hailed as the saviour of Christendom;
it is to this that he owes a good deal of his
glory, and he nobly prepared the world for the
still greater victory of Lepanto to be won by his
son Don John of Austria.</p>

<p>Moreover, it was during his reign that the
great American conquests of the Spanish armies
occurred, and the name of Fernando Cortes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
attained to eternal glory; and the Portuguese
voyager Maghellan made those wonderful discoveries
which have so profoundly influenced
the course of history. There had been no man
so great and energetic as Charles since Charlemagne;
since him his only rival for almost super-human
energy has been Napoleon.</p>

<p>That pathetic and unhappy queen whom we
call “Bloody Mary” had been betrothed to
Charles for diplomatic reasons when she was an
infant, but he had broken off the engagement
and ultimately married Isabella of Portugal,
whose fair face is immortalized by Titian in the
portrait that still hangs in the Prado, Madrid.
Auburn of hair, with blue eyes and delicate
features, she looks the very type of what we used
to call the tubercular diathesis; and there can
be no doubt that Charles really loved her. Before
he married her he had had an illegitimate
daughter by a Flemish girl; ten years after she
died Barbara Blomberg, a flighty German, bore
him a son, the famous Don John of Austria. But
while Isabella lived no scandal attached to his
name. Unhappily his only legitimate son was
Philip, afterwards Philip II of Spain.</p>

<p>When Mary came to the throne she was
intensely unhappy. During the dreadful years
that preceded the divorce of Catherine of Aragon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
Charles had strongly supported Catherine’s cause;
and Mary did not forget his aid when she found
herself a monarch, lonely and friendless. She
let him know that she would be quite prepared
to marry him if he would take her.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Probably
Charles was terrified by the advances of the plain-faced
old maid, but the opportunity of strengthening
the Catholic cause was too good to miss. The
house of Austria was always famous for its matrimonial
skill; the hexameter pasquinade went:</p>

<p class="center">“Bella gerant alii—tu, felix Austria, nube!”<br />
(“Others wage war for a throne—you, happy Austria, marry!”)</p>

<p>Charles, in his dilemma, turned to his son
Philip, who nobly responded to the call of duty.
Of him Gibbon might have said that “he sighed
as a lover, but obeyed as a son” if he had not
said it concerning himself; and Philip broke off
his engagement to the Infanta of Portugal, and
married the fair English bride himself.</p>

<p>Charles was still the greatest and most romantic
figure in Europe—a mighty conqueror and famous
Emperor; any woman would have preferred him
to his mean-spirited son; and Mary was grateful
to him for powerful support during years of
anguish. She obeyed his wishes, and took the
son instead of the father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>Queen Mary’s sad life deserves a word of sympathetic
study. With her mother she had passed
through years of hideous suffering, culminating
in her being forced by her father to declare herself
a bastard—probably the most utterly brutal
act of Henry’s reign. She had seen the fruits
of ungovernable sexuality in the fate of her enemy
Anne Boleyn; added to her plain face this
probably caused her to repress her own sex-complex;
finally she married the wretched young
creature Philip, who, having stirred her sexual
passions, left her to pursue his tortuous policy in
Spain. All the time, as I read the story, she
was really desirous of Charles, his brilliant father.
Love-sick for Charles; love-sick for Philip, to
whom she had a lawful right set at naught by
leagues of sea; love-sick for <i>any</i> man whom her
pride would allow her to possess—and I do not
hint a word against her virtue—she is not a
creature to scorn; she is rather to be pitied. Her
father had been a man of strong passions and
violent deeds; from him she had inherited that
tendency to early degeneration of the cardiovascular
system which led to her death from dropsy
at the early age of forty-two; and her repressed
sex-complex led her into the ways of a ruthless
religious persecution, probably increased by the
object-lesson set her by her hero. From this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
repressed sex-complex also sprang her fierce desire
for a child, though the historians commonly
attribute this emotion to a desire for some one to
carry on her hatred of the Protestants. I remember
the case of a young woman who was a violent
Labour politician; unfortunately it became necessary
for her to lose her uterus because of a fibroid
tumour. She professed to be frantically sorry
because she could no longer bear a son to go into
Parliament to fight the battle of the proletariat
against the wicked capitalist; but once in a moment
of weakness she confessed that what she had
really wanted was not a bouncing young politician,
but merely a dear little baby to be her own child.
Probably some such motive weighed with Mary.
People laughed at her because she used to mistake
any abdominal swelling, or even the normal
diminution of menstruation that occurs with
middle age, for a sign of pregnancy<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>; but
possibly if she had married Charles instead of
Philip, and had lived happily with him as his
wife, she would not have given her people occasion
to call her “Bloody Mary.” She is the saddest
figure in English history. From her earliest
infancy she had been taught to look forward to
a marriage with the wonderful man who to her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
mind—and to the world’s—typified the noblest
qualities of humanity—courage, bravery, rich
and profound wisdom, learning and love of the
beautiful in art and music and literature; friend
and admirer of Titian and gallant helper of her
mother. Her disappointment must have been
terrible when she found him snatched from her
grasp and saw herself condemned either to a life
of old maidenhood or to a loveless marriage with
a mean religious fanatic twelve years younger
than herself. The mentality which led Mary to
persecute the English Protestants contained the
same qualities as had led Joan of Arc to her
career of unrivalled heroism, and to-day leads an
old maid to keep parrots. When an old maid
undresses it is said that she puts a cover over the
parrot’s cage lest the bird should see her nakedness;
that is a phase of the same mentality as
Mary’s and Joan’s. Loneliness, sadness, suppressed
longing for the unattainable—it is cruel
to laugh at an old maid.</p>

<p>But Charles was to show himself mortal. He
had always been a colossal eater, and had never
spared himself either in the field or at the table.
One has to pay for these things; if a man wishes
to be a great leader and to undertake great
responsibilities he must be content to forswear
carnal delights and eat sparingly; and it is hardly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
an exaggeration to say that it is less harmful to
drink too much than to eat too much. At the
age of thirty Charles began to suffer from “gout”—whatever
it was that they called gout in those
days. At the age of fifty he began to lose his
teeth—apparently from pyorrhœa. Possibly
his “gout” may have really been the result of
focal infection from his septic teeth. At fifty his
gout “flew to his head,” and threatened him with
sudden death. When he was fifty-two he suddenly
became pale and thin, and it was noticed
that his hair was rapidly turning grey. Clearly
his enormous gluttony was beginning to result
in arterio-sclerosis, and at fifty-four it was
reported to his enemy the Sultan that Charles
had lost the use of an arm and a leg. Sir William
Stirling-Maxwell thought that this report was
the exaggeration of an enemy; but it is quite
possible that Charles really suffered from that
annoying condition known as “intermittent
claudication,” which is such a nuisance to both
patient and doctor in cases of arterio-sclerosis.
In these attacks there may be temporary paralysis
and loss of the power of speech. The cause of
them is not quite clear, because they seldom prove
fatal; but it is supposed that there is spasm of
some small artery in the brain, or perhaps a
transitory dropsy of some motor area. Charles’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
speech became indistinct, so that towards the
end of his life it was difficult to understand what
he meant. It has generally been supposed that
this was due to his underhung lower jaw and loss
of teeth; but it is equally probable that dropsy
of the speech-centre may have been at the root
of the trouble, such as is so frequently observed
in arterio-sclerosis or its congener chronic Bright’s
disease, and is also often caused by over-strain and
over-eating. He began to feel the cold intensely,
and sat shivering even under the warmest wraps;
he said himself that the cold seemed to be in his
bones. Probably there was some spasm of the
arterioles, such as is often seen in arterio-sclerosis.</p>

<p>By this time, what with the failure of his plans
against the Protestants and his wretched health,
he had made up his mind to resign the burden of
Empire, and to seek repose in some warmer
climate, where he could rest in the congenial
atmosphere of a monastery. No Roman Emperor
had voluntarily resigned the greatest position in
the world since Diocletian in <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 305; curiously
enough he too had been a persecutor, so that his
reign is known among the hagiographers as “the
age of martyrs.”</p>

<p>Charles called together a great meeting at the
Castle of Caudenburg in Brussels in 1556. All the
great ones of the Empire were there, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
Knights of the Golden Fleece, an order which
still vies for greatness with our own order of the
Garter; possibly it may now even excel that order,
because it is unlikely that it will ever again be
conferred by an Austrian Emperor. Like the
Garter, it had “no damned pretence of merit
about it.” If you were entitled to wear the
chain and insignia of the Golden Fleece, you
were a man of very noble birth. Yet, like the
Order of the Thistle, the Fleece may yet be revived,
and may recover its ancient splendour. On
the right of the Emperor sat his son Philip, just
returned, a not-impetuous bridegroom, from
marrying Mary of England. On his left he leant
painfully and short of breath upon the shoulder
of William the Silent, who was soon to become
of some little note in the world. It was a strange
group: the great, bold Emperor whose course
was so nearly run; the mean little king-consort
of England; and the noble patriot statesman who
was soon to drag Philip’s name in the dust of
ignominy. Charles spoke at some length, recounting
how he had won many victories and
suffered many defeats, yet, though so constantly
at war, he had always striven for peace; how he
had crossed the Mediterranean many times
against the Turk, and had made forty long
journeys and many short ones to see for himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
the troubles of his subjects. He insisted proudly
that he had never done any man a cruelty or an
injustice. He burst into tears and sat down,
showing the emotionalism that so often
attends upon high blood-pressure; and the
crowd, seeing the great soldier weep, wept with
him. Eleanor gave him a cordial to drink, and
he resumed, saying that at last he had found the
trials of Empire more than his health would allow
him to sustain. He had decided to abdicate in
favour of his beloved son Philip. It was given to
few monarchs to die and yet to live—to see his
own glory continued in the glory which he
expected for his son. It seems to have been a
really touching and dramatic scene, causing an
immense sensation throughout Europe. If there
were ever an indispensable man it would have
appeared at that time to be the Emperor Charles
V; the world quaked in apprehension.</p>

<p>It was some time before Charles could carry
out his design, but ultimately he went, by a long
and dangerous journey, to the place of his retirement,
Yuste, in Estremadura, Northern Spain,
where there slept a little monastery of followers
of St. Jerome; why he—a Fleming—should have
picked on this lonely and inaccessible place is not
known. With him went a little band of attendants,
chief among whom was his stout old chamberlain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
Don Luis Quixada, of whom we shall hear
more when we come to consider Don John of
Austria. This Quixada seems to have been a
fine type of Spanish grandee, loyal and faithful;
a merry grandee also, who added sound sense to
jocund playfulness. Note well the name; we shall
meet it again to some purpose.</p>

<p>Charles was mistaken in supposing that he
could find rest at Yuste; the world would not
let him rest. He had been a figure too overwhelming.
He spent his days in reading dispatches
from all who were in trouble and fancied
that the great man could pluck them from the
toils. Chief of his suppliants was his son Philip,
who found the mantle that had seemed to sit so
easily on his father’s mighty shoulders intolerably
heavy when he came to wear it himself. To the
man who is strong in his wisdom and resolution
difficulties disappear when they are boldly faced.
Philip was timorous, poor-spirited, pedantic, and
procrastinating. He constantly appealed to his
father for advice, and Charles responded in letters
which seem to show, in their evidence of annoyance,
the irritability that goes with a high blood-pressure.
An epidemic of Reformation was
breaking out in Spain, however sterile might
seem the soil of that nation for Protestantism to
flourish. It is not quite clear why no serious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
move towards the Reformed Religion ever took
place among the Spaniards. It is probable that
the ancient faith had thrust its roots too deeply
into their hearts during the centuries of struggle
against the Moors. In the minds of the Spanish
people it had been the Church which had inspired
their ancestors—not the kings; and they
were not going to desert the old religion now
that they saw it attacked by the Germans. Moreover,
the fierce repression which was practised
by the Spanish Inquisition must have had its
effect. Lecky formed the opinion that no new
idea could survive in the teeth of really determined
persecution; and the history of religion in
Spain and France seems to bear him out.</p>

<p>However, the old war-horse in his retirement
snuffed the battle and the joyous smell of the
burnings, and stoutly urged on the Inquisitors,
at whatever cost to his own quiet. Spain remained
diligently Roman Catholic at the orders
of the Holy Roman Emperor and his son Philip;
and at this moment, when Charles was so urgently
longing for peace and retirement, English Mary,
his cousin and daughter-in-law, in whose interests
he had loyally braved God, man, and Pope, lost
Calais; the French, under the Duke of Guise, took
it from her. She might well grieve and say the
name would be found written on her heart; she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
but echoed the feelings of her beloved Emperor.
For weeks he mumbled with toothless jaws the
agony of his soul over this crowning misfortune,
and from this he never really recovered. Already
how had the times changed since the Spanish
infantry had overrun Europe at his command!</p>

<p>But he could do nothing; he had abdicated.
That iron hand was now so crippled with gout
that it could hardly even open an envelope, had
to sign its letters with a seal, and constantly held
a tiny chafing-dish to keep itself warm. Charles
sat shivering and helpless, wrapped in a great
eiderdown cloak even in midsummer; his eyes
fell on the portrait of his beloved wife and of
that plain Mary who had wished to marry him,
and on several favourite pictures by Titian. He
listened to the singing of the friars, and was
resentful of the slightest wrong note, for he had
an exceedingly acute musical ear. The good
fathers, in their attempts to entertain him,
brought famous preachers to preach to him; he
listened dutifully—he, whose lightest word had
once shaken Europe, but who now could hardly
mumble in a slurring voice! And in spite of
the protests of Quixada he heroically sat down
to eat himself to death. It has been said that
marriage for an old man is merely a pleasant way
of committing suicide; it is doubtful whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
Charles enjoyed his chosen method of self-poisoning,
for he had lost the sense of taste, and
no food could be too richly seasoned for his tired
palate. Vast quantities of beef, mutton, venison,
ham, and highly flavoured sausages went past
those toothless jaws, washed down by the richest
wines, the heaviest beers; the local hidalgoes
quickly discovered that to reach the Emperor’s
heart all they had to do was to appeal to his
stomach, so they poured in upon him every kind
of rich dainty, to the despair of Quixada, who
did his best to protect his master. “Really,”
said he, “kings seem to think that their stomachs
are not made like other men’s!”</p>

<p>He sometimes used to go riding, but one day,
when he was mounting his pony, he was suddenly
seized with an attack of giddiness so severe that
he nearly fell into the arms of Quixada, so that
the Emperor, who had once upon a time been
the <i>beau ideal</i> of a light cavalryman, had to toil
about heavily on foot in the woods, and to
strive to hold his gun steadily enough to shoot a
wood-pigeon.</p>

<p>He spent his spare time watching men lay out
for him new parterres and planting trees; man
began with a garden, and in sickness and sorrow
ends with one. The Earth-Mother is the one
friend that never deserts us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>For some time he took a daily dose of senna,
which was probably the best thing he could have
taken in the absence of Epsom salts, but nothing
could get rid of the enormous amount of rich
food that poured down his gullet. He was
always thinking of death, and there seems to be
little doubt that he really did rehearse his own
funeral. He held a great and solemn procession,
catafalque and all, and, kneeling in front of the
altar, handed to the officiating friar a taper,
which was symbolical of his own soul. He then
sat during the afternoon in the hot sun, and
it was thought that he caught a feverish chill,
for he took to his bed and never left it alive; for
hours he held the portrait of Isabella in his hands,
recalling her fresh young beauty; he clasped to
his bosom the crucifix which he had taken from
her dead fingers just before they had become
stiff. Then came the fatal headache and vomiting
which so often usher in the close of chronic
Bright’s disease. We are told that he lay unconscious,
holding his wife’s crucifix, till he said:
“Lord, I am coming to Thee!” His hand
relaxed—was the motor-centre becoming œdematous?—and
a bishop held the crucifix before his
dying eyes. Charles sighed, “Aye—Jesus!” and
died. Whether or no he died so soon after
saying these things as the good friar would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
us believe, it is certain that his end was edifying
and pious, and such as he would have wished.</p>

<p>The great interest of Charles V to a doctor,
now that the questions over which he struggled
so fiercely are settled, is that we can seldom trace
so well in any historical character the course of
the disease from which he died. If Charles had
been content to live on milky food and drink less
it is probable that he would have lived for years;
he might have yielded to the constant entreaties
of his friends and resumed the imperial crown;
he might have taken into his strong hands the
guidance of Spain and the Netherlands that was
overwhelming Philip; his calm good sense might
have averted the rising flood that ultimately
led to the revolt of the Netherlands; possibly he
might even have averted the Spanish Armada,
though it seems improbable that he could have
lived thirty years. But Spain might have avoided
that arrogant behaviour which has since that day
caused so many of her troubles; with the substitution
of Philip for Charles at that critical time
she took a wrong turning from which she has
never since recovered.</p>

<p>The death of Charles V caused an extraordinary
sensation in Europe—even greater than the
sensation caused by his abdication. Immense
memorial services were held all over the Empire;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
people wondered how they were ever to recover
from the loss. Stout old Quixada said boldly
that Charles V was the greatest man that ever
had been or ever would be in the world. If
we differ from him, at all events his opinion helps
us to appreciate the extraordinary impression that
Charles had made upon his time, and it is now
generally agreed that he was the greatest man of
the sixteenth century, which was so prodigal
of remarkable men. Possibly William the Silent
might be thought still greater; but he was much
less resplendent; he lacked the knightly glamour
that surrounded the head of the Holy Roman
Emperor; he wore no Golden Fleece; no storied
centuries fluttered over his head. Yet, if we
come to seek a cause for this immense impression,
it is not easy to find. There is no doubt that he
was a stout defender of the old religion at a
time when it sorely needed defenders, and to that
extent Romance broods over his memory—the
romance of things that are old. He was a man
of remarkable energy, and a great soldier at a
time when soldiering was not distinguished by
genius. He appears to have had great personal
charm, though I can find few sayings attributed
to him by which we can judge the source of that
charm. There is nothing in his history like the
gay insouciance, the constant little personal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
letters to friends, of Henri Quatre; things with
Charles V seem to have been rather serious and
legal than friendly. He was fond of simple joys,
like watchmaking, and he got a remarkable
clockmaker, one Torriano, to accompany him to
Yuste to amuse his last months. He left behind
him a great many watches, and naturally the
story grew that he had said: “If I cannot even
get my watches to agree, how can I expect my
subjects to follow one religion?” But it is probable
that this pretty story is quite apocryphal;
it is certainly very unlike Charles’s strongly
religious—not to say bigoted—character. He
was proud and autocratic, yet could unbend,
and the friars of Yuste found him a good friend.
The boys of the neighbouring village used to
rob his orchard, much to the disgust of the
Emperor; he set the police on their track, but
died before the case came up for trial. After
his death it was found that he had left instructions
that the fines which he expected to receive from
the naughty little ragamuffins were to be given
to the poor of their village. Among these
naughty little boys was probably young Don
John of Austria, whom Quixada had brought to
see his supposed father; and it is said that Charles
acknowledged him before he died.</p>

<p>Lastly, Charles had the inestimable advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
of being depicted by one of the greatest artists of
all time. It is impossible to look upon his sad
and thoughtful face, as drawn by the great
Titian, without sympathy. The strong, if underhung,
jaw which he bequeathed to his descendants
and is still to be seen in King Alfonso of Spain;
the wide-set and thoughtful eyes; the care-worn
furrowed brow; the expression of energy and
calm wisdom: all these belonged to a great man.</p>

<p>Two hundred years after he died, when his
body had long been removed to the Escorial
where it now lies in solemn company with the
bodies of many other Spanish monarchs, a strange
fate allowed a visiting Scotsman to view it.
Even after that great lapse of time it was, though
mummified, little affected by decay; there were
still on his winding-sheet the sprigs of thyme
which his friends had placed there; and the
grave and stately features as painted by Titian
were still vividly recognizable.</p>

<p>We should be quite within the bounds of reason
in saying that Charles V was the greatest man
between Charlemagne and Napoleon. He was
less knightly than Charlemagne—probably because
we know more about him; he had no
Austerlitz nor Jena to his credit—nor any Moscow;
but in devouring energy and vastness of conception
there was little to choose between the three.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
Charlemagne left behind him the Holy Roman
Empire with its enormous mediæval significance,
whereas Napoleon and Charles V left comparatively
little or nothing. He was the heroic
defender of a losing cause, and wears the romantic
halo that such heroes wear; yet whatever halo
of chivalry, romance, and religious fervour
surrounds his name, it is difficult to forget that
he deliberately ate himself to death. An ignoble
end.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Don John of Austria, Cervantes,<br />
and Don Quixote</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TWO great alliances, of which you will read
nothing in ordinary history-books, have pre-eminently
influenced mankind. The first was
between the Priest and the Woman, and seems
to have begun in Neolithic times, when Woman
was looked upon as a witch with some uncanny
power of bewitching honest men and somehow
bringing forth useless brats for no earthly reason
that could be discovered. From this alliance
grew the worship of Motherhood, and hence many
more modern religions. When, on Sundays, you
see ranks of men in stiff collars sitting in church
though they would much rather be playing tennis,
you know that they are expiating in misery the
spankings inflicted by their Neolithic ancestors
perhaps 10,000 years ago: their wives have driven
them to church, and Woman, as usual, has had
the last word.</p>

<p>But the other alliance, that between Man and
Horse, has been a more terrible affair altogether,
and has led to Chivalry, the cult of the Man on
the Horse, of the Aristocrat, of the Rich Man.
Though the Romans had a savage aristocracy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
they never had Chivalry, probably because they
never feared the cavalryman. The Roman legion,
in its open order, could face any cavalry, because
the legionary knew that the man by his side
would not run away; if he, being a misbegotten
son of fear, did so, then the man behind him would
take advantage of the plungings of the horse to
drive his javelin into the silly animal while he
himself would use his sword upon the rider. It
was left for the Gran Catalan Company of Spain
and the Scots under Wallace and Bruce to prove
in mediæval times that the infantryman would
beat the cavalryman.</p>

<p>The Romans never adopted the artificial rules
of Chivalry; it was the business of the legions
to win battles—to make money over the business
if they could, but first and foremost to win battles.
They had no ideas about the “point of honour”
which has cost so many a man his life. The main
thing was that the legions must not run away;
it was for the enemy to do the running. To the
Romans it never seems to have occurred that
Woman was a creature to be sentimentally worshipped,
or that it really mattered very much
whether you spoke of a brace of grouse or a couple,
of a mob of hounds or a pack; but to the Knight
of Chivalry these were vital matters.</p>

<p>With Charlemagne and his Franks a new civilization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
came into full flower; and Chivalry—the
“worship of God and the ladies,” to quote
Gibbon’s ironic phrase—swayed the minds of
Northern Europe for centuries.</p>

<p>Chivalry has been much misunderstood in
modern times. We probably see Chaucer’s
“varry parfit gentil knight” as poets and idealists
would have us see him and not as he really was.
There was no sentimentality about your knight.
“Gentle” did not mean “kind”; it meant
really “son of a landowner.” A knight had to
do things in the manner considered fashionable
by his class; he had to call things precisely by
the names taught him by some older knight—his
tutor and university combined; the slightest
slip and he would be considered as the mediæval
equivalent of our “bounder”; he had to wear
the proper clothes at the proper time, and to
obey certain arbitrary—often quite artificial—“manners
and rules of good society,” or he would
be considered lacking in “good form”; he must
recognize the rights of the rich as against the
poor, but it did not follow that he should recognize
any rights of the poor as against the rich.
Even Bayard, knight <i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>,
would probably have seemed a most offensive
fellow to a twentieth-century gentleman if he,
with his modern ideas, could have met the Chevalier;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
and the sensation caused by the kindly
conduct of Sir Philip Sidney in handing his drink
of water to a wounded soldier at Zutphen shows
how rare such a thing must have been. It was
done a thousand times in the late war, and
nobody thought anything about it. To the
extent of the sensation of Zutphen Chivalry had
debased mankind; the evil that it did lived after
it. It did good in teaching the world manners
and a certain standard of honourable conduct;
it did not teach morality, or real religion, or real
kindness. These things were left for the poor to
teach the rich.</p>

<p>This unsentimental harangue leads us to “the
last knight of Europe”—Don John of Austria,
around whose name there still shines a glamour of
romance like the sound of a trumpet. About
nine years after the death of the Empress Isabel,
Charles V went a-wandering, still disconsolate,
through his mighty empire. He was sad and
lonely, for it was about the time when the arterio-sclerosis
which was to kill him began to depress
his spirits. At Ratisbon, where he lay preparing
for the great campaign which was to end in the
glorious victory of Muhlburg, they brought to
him to cheer him up a sweet singer and pretty
girl named Barbara Blomberg, daughter of a
noble family. She sang to the Emperor to such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
purpose that he became her lover, and in due
course Don John was born. By this time Charles
had discovered that his pretty nightingale was a
petulant, extravagant, sensual young woman, by
no means the sort of mother a wise man would
select to bring up his son; so he took the boy
from her care and sent him to a poor Spanish
family near Madrid. Whatever Charles V did
in his private life seems to have borne the stamp
of wisdom and kindness, however little we may
agree with some of his public actions. Probably
Barbara did not object; it must have been rather
alarming for the flighty young person to have the
tremendous personality of the great Emperor
constantly overlooking her folly; she married a
man named Kugel, ruined him by her extravagance,
and died penniless save for an annuity of
200 florins left her by the Emperor in his will.
I read a touch of sentimentality into Charles’s
character. It is difficult to wonder more at his
memory of his old light-of-love in his will, or at
his accurate and uncomplimentary estimate of
her value. Probably he was rather ashamed of
some of his memories; so far as I can find out
there were not many such, and he wished to hush
up the whole incident. Probably Barbara was
not worth much more than 200 florins per annum.</p>

<p>Still keeping secret the parentage of the child,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
whom he called Jeronimo after his favourite
saint, Charles handed him over to the care of
his steward, Don Luis de Quixada, asking that
Maddalena his wife should regard Jeronimo as
her own son. Quixada had not been married
very long, and naturally Maddalena wondered
whence came this cheery little boy of which
Quixada seemed so fond; nor would he gratify
her curiosity, but hushed her with dark sayings;
she kissed the baby in public, but wept in secret
for jealousy of the wicked female who had evidently
borne a son in secret to her husband before
he had married his lawful wife. One night the
castle caught fire, and Quixada, flower of Spain’s
chivalry though he was, rescued the child before
he returned to save Maddalena. It is wrong to
call him a “grandee of Spain,” for “grandee”
is a title much the same as our “duke”; had
he been a grandee I understand that his true
name would have been “Señor Don Quixada,
duca e grandi de España.” One would think
that this action would have added fuel to Maddalena’s
jealousy, but she believed her husband when
he told her that Jeronimo was a child of such
surpassing importance to the world that it had
been necessary for a Quixada to save him even
before he saved his wife, and quite probably she
then, for the first time, began to suspect his real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
parentage. Charles V was then the great Catholic
hero, and the whole Catholic world was
weeping for his abdication. So Maddalena developed
a strong love for Jeronimo, which died only
with herself. She lived for a great many years
and bore no children; Jeronimo remained to her
as her only son. He always looked upon her as
his mother, and throughout his life wrote to her
letters which are still delightful to read; whatever
duty he had, in whatever part of the world,
he always found time to write to Maddalena in
the midst of it, and, like a real mother, she kept
the letters.</p>

<p>It is said that Charles when dying kissed
Jeronimo and called him son; he certainly
provided for him in his will. After his death
Quixada at first tried to keep the matter secret,
but afterwards sent him to live at the Court with
his brother Philip II, who treated him as he
treated everybody else but Charles V—“the one
wise and strong man whom he never suspected,
never betrayed, and never undervalued,” as
Stirling-Maxwell says. Jeronimo was then openly
acknowledged by Philip as Charles’s natural son,
being called Don John of Austria. Philip’s own
son, a youth of small intelligence, who afterwards
died under restraint—Philip was of course accused
of poisoning him—once called him <i>bâtarde et<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
fils de putaine</i>—bastard and strumpet’s son. The
curly-headed little boy kept his hands by his side
and quietly replied, “Possibly so; but at any
rate I had a better <i>father</i> than you!” Even by
that time he had begun to see that his mother
was no saint, and could tell between a great
man and a little. Philip could never forgive
Don John for being a gallant youth such as his
father had hoped that Philip would be and was
not; and Don John, conscious of his mighty
ancestry, ardently longed to be a real gallant King
of Romance, such as his father had hoped Philip
would become. Charles, in his will, had expressed
a hope that he would be a monk, and Philip
actively fought for this, though Charles had left
the decision to Don John’s own wishes. In
Philip’s eyes no doubt a gay and bold younger
brother would be less dangerous to the State—i.e.
to Philip—as a monk than as a soldier; yet
is it not possible that Philip only thought he was
loyally helping to follow out his father’s wishes?
He was generally a “slave of duty,” though his
slavery often led him into tortuous courses. The
Church is a great leveller, and religion is a pacifying
and amaranthine repast. But no monkish cowl
would suit Don John; his locks were fair and
hyacinthine, and no tonsure should degrade them.
After a struggle Philip yielded, and Don John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
was sent in command of the galleys against the
Algerian pirates. He did well, and next year he
commanded the land forces against the rebel
Moriscoes of Granada. Here, in his very first
battle, he lost his foster-father and mentor,
Quixada, who died a knightly death in rallying
the army when it meditated flight. A true knight
of Spain, this Quixada, from the time when he
took the little son of imperial majesty under his
care till the time when he gave up his life lest
that little son, now become a radiant young man,
should suffer dishonour by his army running away.
All Spain, from Philip downward, mourned the
death of this most valiant gentleman, which is
another thing that makes me think that Philip’s
conduct towards Don John was not quite so
black as it has been painted. He could certainly
recognize worth when it did not conflict with
his own interests—that is to say, with the interests
of Spain as he saw them. Quixada’s action in
concealing the parentage of Don John from his
wife was just the sort of loyal and unwise thing
that might have been expected from a chivalrous
knight, using the word “chivalrous” as it is
commonly understood to-day; a dangerous thing,
for many a woman would not have had sufficient
faith in her husband to believe him when he suddenly
produced an unexplained and charming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
little boy soon after he was married. Maddalena
de Ulloa acted like an angel; Don Quixada acted
like—Don Quixote! Now we see why I asked you
particularly to note the name when we first came
across it in the essay on Charles V. Whence did
Cervantes get the idea for Don Quixote if not
from the foster-father of Don John?</p>

<p>Two years later he got the real chance of his
life. The Turks, having recovered from the
shock inflicted on them by Charles V, captured
Cyprus and seemed about to conquer all the
little republics of the Adriatic. The Pope, Pius
V, organized the “Holy League” between Spain
and Venice, between the most fiercely monarchical
of countries and the most republican of cities;
and Don John was appointed Admiral-in-chief
of the combined fleets of the “Last Crusade,”
as the enterprise is called from its mingled gallantry
and apparent unity and idealism. For the
last time men stood spellbound as Christendom
attacked Mohammed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>It is difficult for us nowadays to realize the
terror of the Turks that possessed Europe in the
sixteenth century; mothers quieted their children
by the dreadful name, and escaped sailors recounted
indescribable horrors in every little seaport from
Albania to Scotland. Many thousands of Christian
slaves laboured at the oars of the war-galleys,
not, as is generally thought, as hostages
that these galleys might not be sunk. They
were the private property of the captains, who
treated their own property better than they
treated the property of the Grand Turk. Thus,
it was not the worst fate for a Christian galley-slave
to serve in the galley of his owner. He
would not be exposed to reckless sinking at any
rate; if the galley sank, it would be because the
owner could not help it. Nor would he be likely
to be impaled upon a red-hot poker or thrown
upon butchers’ hooks, as might happen to the
slave of the Sultan. So it would seem that some
unnecessary pity has been spilt upon the slaves
of the galleys. Their lot might have been worse,
to put things in their most favourable light.</p>

<p>This “last crusade” culminated in the great
battle of Lepanto, in 1571, where the Turks lost
about 35,000 men and their whole battle fleet
except forty galleys which crawled home disabled.
There was a good deal of discussion about the
action of an Italian galley under Doria, but
Cervantes, in <i>Don Quixote</i>, seems to have been
quite satisfied with it. No such wonderful battle
was fought at sea until the Nile itself, which is
the most perfect of all sea-fights.</p>

<p>The sensation throughout Europe was indescribable.
Everything helped to make the victory
romantic—the gallant young bastard admiral
compared with the unattractive king under whom
he served, the sudden relief from terrible danger,
and the victory of Christ over Mahound, so
dramatic and complete, all combined to stir the
pulses of Christendom as they had never been
stirred before—even in the earlier Crusades when
the very tomb of Christ was the point under
dispute. Men said that Mahound, when he
heard the guns of Don John, wept upon the knees
of his houris in his Paradise; black Azrael, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
angel of death, had turned traitor upon his
worshippers.</p>

<p>This glorious victory was won largely by the
extraordinary daring and inspiring personality
of the Emperor’s bastard, who now, at the
summit of human glory, saw himself condemned
to retire into the position of a subject. The rest
of the life of the “man who would be king” is
the record of thwarted ambition and disappointed
hopes. Spain and Venice quarrelled, and Lepanto
was not followed up; Philip lost the chance
of retrieving 1453 and of changing the history
of Europe in Spain’s favour ever since. Christian
set once more to killing Christian in the old
melancholy way; Venice made peace with the
Sultan, and Don John set about carving out a
kingdom for himself. In dreams he saw himself
monarch of Albania, or of the Morea; and in
body he actually recaptured Tunis, once so
gloriously held by his father. But Philip would
not support him and he had to retire. Cervantes,
in <i>Don Quixote</i>, evidently thinks Philip quite
right. Tunis was a “sponge for extravagance,
and a moth for expense; and as for holding it
as a monument to Charles V, why, what monument
was necessary to glory so eternal?” Don
John returned home without a kingdom to his
brother, who no doubt let him see that he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
becoming rather a nuisance with his expensive
dreams. In 1576 he was placated by an appointment
as Governor-General to the Netherlands,
where he quickly found himself confronted by a
much greater, though less romantic, man than
himself. William of Orange was now the unquestioned
leader of the revolt of the Dutch against the
Roman Catholic power of Philip, and when Don
John reached the Netherlands he found himself
Governor with no subjects. After fruitless negotiations
he retired, a very ill man, to Namur; he
had become thin and pale, and lost his vivacity.
His heart was not in his task. He was meditating
the extraordinary “empresa de Inglaterra”—the
“enterprise of England”—which now seems
to us so fantastic. The Spanish army was to
evacuate the Netherlands and to be rapidly ferried
across to Yorkshire; by a lightning stroke it
was to release Mary Queen of Scots, that romantic
Queen, and marry her to Don John, the romantic
victor of Lepanto; Elizabeth was to be slain, and
the Pope was to bless the union of romance with
romance. But Elizabeth would have taken a
deal of slaying. One cannot help surmising that
Don John may have dreamed this fantasy because
he had been educated by Quixada; it was a
dream that might have passed through the addled
brain of Don Quixote himself. The victor of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Lepanto should better have understood the
mighty power of the sea; the galleys which had
done so well in the Mediterranean would have
been worse than useless in the North, where the
storms are a worse enemy than the Turks.</p>

<p>But Philip, either through timidity, or jealousy,
or wisdom, would have none of it; after long
delay he sent an important force to the Netherlands
under the command of Don John’s cousin,
Alexander Farnese, Prince of Parma, the greatest
general Spain ever produced. Don John abandoned
his dreams to fall with this army upon
the Protestants at Gemblours, where he, or
Farnese—opinions differ—won a really great
victory, the last that was to honour his name.</p>

<p>A curious incident in this campaign was that
the Spaniards were attacked by a small Scottish
force at a place called Rejnements. The Scotsmen
began, <i>more Scotorum</i>, by singing a psalm.
Having thus prepared the way spiritually, they
prepared it physically by casting off their clothes,
and to the horror of the modest Spaniards
attacked naked with considerable success. Many
of us, no doubt, remember how the Highlanders
in the late war were said to have stained their
bodies with coffee or Condy’s fluid and, under
cover of a Birnam’s wood composed of branches
of trees, emulated the bold Malcolm and Macduff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
by creeping upon the Germans attired mainly
in their boots and identity disks; a sparse costume
in which to appear before nursing sisters should
they be wounded. I had the honour of operating
upon one hefty gentleman who reached the
C.C.S. in this attire, sheltered from the bitter cold
by blankets supplied by considerate Australians
in the field ambulance. We from a southern
land considered the habit more suitable for the
hardy Scot than for ourselves; though we remembered
that an Australian surgeon at Gallipoli,
finding that his dressings had run short, tore
his raiment into strips and, when the need came,
charged the Turks berserk attired in the costume
of Adam before the Fall. But we did not remember
that gallant Scotsmen had done something
similar in 1578. No doubt the sight of a large
man, dressed in cannibal costume and dancing
horribly on the parapet while he poured forth a
string of uncouth Doric imprecations, led to the
tale that the British Army was employing African
natives to devour the astonished Bosche.</p>

<p>Don John could not follow up the victory of
Gemblours. He had neither money nor sufficient
men; the few short months remaining to him
were spent in imploring aid from his brother.
Philip did nothing; possibly he was jealous of
Don John; possibly he was fully occupied over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
the miserable affair of Antonio Perez and the
Princess of Eboli. One would like to think that
he had lucid intervals in which he recognized the
insensate folly of the whole business; but like
his father he was spurred on by his conscience.
In addition to the other troubles of Don John
his army began to waste away with pestilence,
no doubt, it being now autumn, with typhoid,
that curse of armies before the recent discovery
of T.A.B. inoculation. Don John fell sick, in
September, 1578, of a fever, but, his doctors
considering the illness trifling, continued to work.
One Italian, indeed, said that he would die,
whereas another sick man, believed to be <i>in articulo
mortis</i>, would recover. The guess proved
right, and when Don John died the Italian
surgeon’s fortune was made. Thus easily are
some reputations gained in our profession; it
is easier to make a reputation than to keep
it.</p>

<p>For nearly three weeks Don John struggled to
work, encouraged by his physicians; there came
a day, towards the end of September, when he,
being already much wasted by his illness, was
seized by a most violent pain and immediately
had to go to bed. He became delirious, and
babbled of battle-fields and trumpet-calls; he
gave orders to imaginary lines of battle; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
became unconscious. After two days of muttering
delirium he awakened, and, as he was
thought to be <i>in extremis</i>, took extreme unction.
Next day the dying flicker continued, and he heard
the priest say mass; though his sight had failed
and he could not see, he had himself raised in the
bed, feebly turned his head towards the elevation
of the Host and adored the body of Christ
with his last glimmer of consciousness. He then
fell back unconscious, and sank into a state of
coma, from which he never rallied. In all, he
had been ill about twenty-four days.</p>

<p>These events could be easily explained on the
supposition that this young man’s brave life was
terminated by that curse of young soldiers—ruptured
typhoid ulcer in ambulatory typhoid
fever. His army was dwindling with pestilence;
he himself walked about feeling feverish and
“seedy” and losing weight rapidly for a fortnight;
he was just at the typhoid age, in the typhoid
time of the year, and in typhoid conditions;
his ulcer burst, causing peritonitis; the tremendous
shock of the rupture, together with the
toxæmia, drove him delirious and then unconscious;
being a very strong young man he woke
up again as the first shock passed away; as the
shock passed into definite peritonitis unconsciousness
returned, and he was fortunate in being able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
to hear his last mass before he died. I see no
flaw in this reasoning.</p>

<p>The rest of the story is rather quaint. By
next spring Philip had given orders for the
embalmed body to be brought to Spain, and it
was considered rather mean of him that the body
of his brother was to be brought on mule-back.
But Philip was at his wits’ end for money to
prosecute the war, and no doubt he himself looked
upon his “meanness” as a wise economy. The
body was exhumed, cut into three pieces—apparently
by disjointing it at the hips—and stuffed
into three leather bags which were slung on
mule-back in a pack-saddle. When it came
within a few miles of the Escorial it was put
together again, laid upon a bier, and given a
noble funeral in a death-chamber next to that
which had been reserved for the great Emperor
his father. There I believe it still lies, the winds
of the Escorial laughing at its dreams of chivalrous
glory.</p>

<p>Philip, suspicious of everybody and everything,
had given orders that, should Don John die, his
confessor was to keep an accurate record of the
circumstances; and it is from the report of this
priest that the above account has been drawn by
Stirling-Maxwell, so we can look upon it as
authoritative. Philip was accused of poisoning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
him, and for a moment this supposition was borne
out by the extreme redness of the intestines;
but this is much more easily explained by the
peritonitis. Again, Philip’s enemies have said
that Don John died of a broken heart, because
the priest reported that one side of his heart was
dry and empty; but this too is quite natural if
we suppose that the last act of Don John’s life
was for his heart to pump its blood into his arteries,
as so often happens in death. Young men do
not die of broken hearts; “Men have died and
worms have eaten them—but not for love!”
as Rosalind says in her sweet cynicism. In
elderly men with high blood-pressures it is quite
possible that grief and worry may actually cause
the heart to burst, and to that extent novelists
are right in speaking of a “broken heart.” Otherwise
the disease, or casualty, is unknown to
medicine. No amount of worry, or absence of
worry, would have had any effect upon Don John’s
typhoid ulcer.</p>

<p>Besides the suspicion of poisoning, Don John
was rumoured to have died of the “French
disease,” even the name of the lady being mentioned.
While he was certainly no more moral
than any other gay and handsome young prince
of his time, there is not the slightest reason for
supposing the rumour to have been anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
but folly. Syphilis does not kill a man as Don
John died, while ambulatory typhoid fever most
assuredly does. Therefore the lady in question
must remain without her glory so far as this
book is concerned, though her name has survived,
and not only in Spanish.</p>

<p>Don John was a handsome young man, graceful
and strong. There are many contemporary
portraits of him, perhaps the best being a magnificent
statue at Messina, which he saved from
the Turks at Lepanto. He had frank blue eyes
and yellow curls, and a very great charm of
manner; but he was liable to attacks of violent
pride which estranged his friends. He was the
darling of the ladies, and was esteemed the flower
of chivalry in his day; but William of Orange
warned his Netherlanders not to be deceived by
his appearance; in his view Philip had sent a
monster of cruelty no less savage than himself.
But William was prejudiced, and Don John is
still one of the great romantic figures of history.
It is difficult to speculate reasonably on what
might have happened if he had not died. It has
been thought that he might have led the Armada,
in which case that most badly-managed expedition
would at least have been well led, and no doubt
England would have had a more determined
struggle; but it seems to me more likely that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
Don John and Philip would have quarrelled, and
that Fortune would have been even less kind to
Spain than she was. Those who love Spain
must be on the whole rather glad that Don John
died before he had been able to cause more
trouble than he did. It is difficult to agree
entirely with those who would put the blame
entirely on Philip for the troubles between him
and Don John, or would interpret every act of
Philip to his detriment. The whole story might
be equally interpreted as the effort of a most
conscientious and narrow-minded man endeavouring
to follow out what he thought to be his
father’s wishes and at the same time to keep a
wild young brother from kicking over the traces.
Compare Butler’s, <i>The Way of All Flesh</i>.</p>

<p>But the real interest to us of Don John is in
his relations with Cervantes.</p>

<div class="verse">And he sees across a weary land a winding road in Spain</div>

</div></div>

<p>And it will be a sad world indeed when Don
Quixote at last reaches the top of that winding
road and men cease to love him.</p>

<p>At Lepanto Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra
(please pronounce the “a’s” separately) was
about twenty-five years of age, and was lying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
below deck sick of a fever. When he heard the
roar of the guns of Don John he sprang from his
bed and rushed on deck in spite of the orders
of his captain; he was put in charge of a boat’s
crew of twelve men and went through the thick
of the fighting. Every man in Don John’s fleet
was fired with his religious enthusiasm, and
Cervantes’ courage was only an index of the wild
fervour that distinguished the Christians on that
most bloody day. He was wounded in the left
hand, “for the greater glory of the right,” as
he himself quaintly says, and never again could
he move the fingers of the injured hand; no
doubt the tendon sheaths had become septic, and
he was lucky to have kept the hand at all. It
has been sapiently remarked that the world would
have had a great loss if it had been the right
hand; but healthy people who lose the right
hand can easily learn to write with the left.
Cervantes remained in the fleet for some years
until, on his way home, he was captured by
Algerian pirates; put to the service of a Christian
renegade—a man who had turned Mussulman
to save his life or from still less worthy
motive—Cervantes made several attempts to
escape, but these were unsuccessful, and he remained
in captivity for some years until his
family had scraped up enough to ransom him.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
In <i>Don Quixote</i> there is a good deal about the
renegadoes, and much of the well-known story
of the “escaped Moor” is probably autobiographical;
from these hints we gather that the
renegadoes were not quite so bad as has been
generally thought, or else that Cervantes was
far too big-minded a man to believe unnecessary
evil about anybody.</p>

<p>Back in Spain, he went into the army for two
years, until, in 1582, he gave up soldiering and
took to literature. He found the pen “a good
stick but a bad crutch,” and in 1585 returned to
the public service as deputy-purveyor of the
fleet. In 1594 he became collectors of revenues
in Granada, and in 1597 he became short in his
accounts and fell into jail. There he seems to
have begun <i>Don Quixote</i>; he somehow obtained
security for the repayment of the missing money,
was released penniless into a suspicious world,
and published the first part of <i>Don Quixote</i> in
1605. It was enormously well received, and from
that day to this has remained one of the most
successful of all books. Ten years later he found
that dishonest publishers were issuing spurious
second parts, so he sat himself down to write a
genuine sequel. This differs from most sequels
in that it is better than the original; it is wiser,
mellower, less ironical; Don Quixote and Sancho<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Panza are still more lovable than they were
before, and one imagines that Cervantes must
have spent the whole ten years in collecting—or
inventing—the wonderful proverbs so wisely
uttered by the squire.</p>

<p>Though Cervantes wrote many plays he is
now remembered mainly by his one very great
romance, which is read lovingly in every language
of every part of the world, so that the
epithet “Quixotic” is applied everywhere to
whatsoever is both gallant and foolish; an epithet
which reflects the mixture of affection and pity
in which the old Don is universally held, and is
more often considered to be a compliment than
the reverse. Curiously enough, women seldom
seem to like Don Quixote; only the other day
a brilliant young woman graduate told me that
she thought he was a “silly old fool!” That
was all she could see in him; but he is universally
now thought to represent the pathos of the man
who is born out of his time. As has been so well
said, “This book is not meant for laughter—it
is meant for tears.” I can do no more than
advise everybody to get a thin-paper copy and
let it live in the pocket for some months, reading
it at odd moments; it is the wisest and wittiest
book ever published. “Blessed be the man
who invented sleep,” is a typical piece of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
Panzan philosophy with which most wise men
will agree.</p>

<p>But when we have done sentimentalizing over
the hidden meaning that undoubtedly underlies
Don Quixote, we must not forget that it is
extraordinarily funny even to a modern mind.
The law that the humour of one generation is
merely grotesque to the next does not seem to
apply to <i>Don Quixote</i>; and I dare swear that the
picture of the mad old Don, brought home from
the inn of Maritornes, looking so stately in a cage
upon a bullock-wagon, guarded by troopers of
the Holy Brotherhood, and escorted by the priest
and the barber, with the distracted Sancho Panza
buzzing about wondering what has become of
his promised Governorship, is absolutely the
funniest thing in all literature; all the funnier
because the springs of our laughter flow from
the fount of our tears.</p>

<p>Now I cannot help thinking that when Cervantes
began to write <i>Don Quixote</i> in prison,
feeling bitter and sore against a world which had
imprisoned him, and stiffened his hand for him,
and condemned him to poverty and imprisonment,
he must have had in his mind the story of the
young bastard of Imperial Majesty who had risen
to such heights of glory over Lepanto. It is not
contended that Don Quixote was consciously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
intended to be a characterizature of Don Quixada
or Don John, though his real name was Alonzo
Quixana or Quixada, Don Quixote being a
<i>nom de guerre</i> born of his frenzy; but I find it
hard to believe that Cervantes had not heard of
the foolish loyalty of Quixada in the matter of
Jeronimo, or of the romantic dreams of Don John.
It would seem that in these two incidents we
find the true seeds of <i>Don Quixote</i>. It is not
true that “Cervantes laughed Spain’s chivalry
away.” Chivalry, meaning the social order of
the true crusades, had long been dead even in
Spain, the most conservative of nations. What
really laughed Spain’s chivalry away was the gay
and joyous laugh of Don John himself, who
would have plunged her into a great war for a
dream. The man who seriously thought of
dashing across the North Sea to marry Mary
Queen of Scots would have been quite capable
of tilting at windmills. In his inmost heart
Cervantes must have seen his folly.</p>

<p>The death of Don Quixote is probably the
most generally famous in literature, vying with
that of Colonel Newcome, though more impressive
because it is less sentimental. Cervantes had
begun by rather jeering at his old Don, and
subjecting him to uncalled-for cudgellings and
humiliations; he then fell in love with the brave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
old lunatic, as everybody else has fallen in love
with him ever since, and by the time that he
came to die had drawn him as a really noble and
beautiful character, who shows all the pathos of
the idealist who is born out of his time. The
death of Don Quixote is, except the death of
one other Idealist, the most affecting death in
all literature; the pathos is secured by means
similarly restrained. The Bachelor Samson Carrasco,
in his determination to cure Don Quixote
of his knight-errant folly, had dressed himself up
as “The Knight of the White Moon,” and
vowed that there was another lady more fair
than Dulcinea del Toboso. At that blasphemy
Don Quixote naturally flew to arms and challenged
the insolent knight. By that time Rosinante
was but old bones, so the Bachelor, being
well-mounted on a young charger, overthrew
the old horse and his brave old rider, and Don
Quixote came to grass with a terrible fall. Then
the Bachelor made Don Quixote vow that he
would cease from his knight-errantry for a whole
year, by which time it was hoped that he would
be cured. They lifted his visor and found the
old man “pale and sweating”; evidently Cervantes
had seen some old man suffering from
shock, and described what he saw in three words.
From this humiliation Don Quixote never really<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
recovered. He reached home and formed the
mad idea of turning shepherd with Sancho and
the Bachelor, and living out his penance in the
fields. But Death saw otherwise, and the old
man answered his call before he could do as he
wished. He was seized with a violent fever that
confined him to his room for six days; finally
he slept calmly for some hours, and again awakened,
only to fall into one attack of syncope after
another until he died; the sanguine assurance
of Sancho Panza that Dulcinea had been successfully
disenchanted could not save him. Like
most idealists he died a sad and disappointed man,
certain of one thing only—that he was out of
touch with the majority of mankind.</p>

<p>Cervantes was far too great an artist to kill
his old hero by some such folly as “brain fever”—which
nonsense I guess to have been typhoid.
I believe that in describing the death of Don
Quixote he was thinking of some old man whom
he had seen crawl home to die after a severe
physical shock, disappointed and disillusioned in
a world of practical youth in which there is no
room for romantic old age—probably some kind
old man whom he himself had loved. These old
men usually die of hypostatic pneumonia, which
has been called the “natural end of man,” and
is probably the real broken heart of popular medicine.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
The old man, after a severe shock, is
affected by a weakened circulation; the lungs are
attacked by a slow inflammation, and he dies,
usually in a few days, in much the same way as
died Don Quixote. Cervantes did not know
that these old men die from inflammation of the
lungs; no doubt he observed the way they die,
and immortalized his memories in the death of
Don Quixote. I have written this to point out
Cervantes’ great powers of observation. He
would probably have made a good doctor in our
day.</p>

<p>This theory of <i>Don Quixote</i>, that at its roots lie
memories of Don John and Don Quixada, is in
no way inconsistent with Cervantes’ own statement
that he wrote the book to ridicule the
romances of Chivalry which were so vitiating the
literary taste of seventeenth-century Spain; at the
back of his mind probably lay his own memories
of foolish and gallant things, quite worthy of
affectionate ridicule such as he has lavished on
his knight-errant.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Philip II and the Arterio-Sclerosis<br />
of Statesmen</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN the Empress Isabel was pregnant
with the child which was to be Philip II,
she bethought her of the glory that was hers in
bearing offspring to a man so famous as the
Roman Emperor, and she made up her mind that
she would comport herself as became a Roman
Empress. When, therefore, her relations and
midwives during the confinement implored her
to cry out or she would die, the proud Empress
answered, “Die I may; but call out I <i>will not</i>!”
and thus Philip arrived into the world sombre son
of a stoical mother and heroic father. Doubtless
she thought that she would show a courage equal
to his father’s, hoping that the son would then
prove not unworthy. Though she was very
beautiful, as Titian’s famous portrait shows, she
seems to have been a gloomy and austere woman,
and Charles, being absent so long from her side
at his wars, had to leave Philip’s education mainly
to her. His part consisted of many affectionate
letters full of good and proud advice. Yet Philip
grew up to be a merry little golden-haired boy
enough, who rode about the streets of Toledo in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
go-cart amidst the crowds that we are told pressed
to see the Emperor’s son. The calamity of his
life was that Charles had bequeathed to him the
kingdom of the Netherlands. Charles himself
was essentially a Fleming, who got on exceedingly
well with his brother Flemings, Reformation or
no Reformation; they were quite prepared to
admit that the great man might have some good
reason for his religious persecution, peculiar
though it no doubt seemed. But Philip was a
foreigner; and a foreigner of the race of Torquemada
who, so they heard, had so strengthened the
Inquisition less than a century before that now
it was really not safe to think aloud in matters of
religion. So the Dutch rose in revolt under
William of Orange, and the Dutch Republic came
into being. Philip was only able to save the
southern Netherlands from the wreck, which
ultimately formed the kingdom of Belgium.
Philip always thought that if he could only get
England on his side the pacification of the Netherlands
would be easy; so, at the earnest request of
Charles, he married Mary Tudor, a woman
twelve years older than himself, a marriage which
turned out unhappily from every point of view,
and has wrongly coloured our general opinion of
Philip’s character. The unfortunate attempt to
conquer England by the Armada, a fleet badly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
equipped and absurdly led, has also led us to
despise both him and his Spaniards, whence came
the general English schoolboy idea that the
Spanish were a nation of braggarts ruled by a
murderous fool, whose only thirst was for Protestant
gore. But this idea was very far from being
true. Philip was no fool; he was an exceedingly
learned, conscientious, hard-working, careful, and
painstaking bureaucrat, who might have done
very well indeed had he been left the kingdom of
Spain alone; but had no power of attracting
foreigners to his point of view. He always did
his best according to his lights; and if his policy
sometimes appears tortuous to us, that is simply
because we forget that it was then thought
perfectly right for kings to do tortuous things
for the sake of their people, just as to-day party
leaders sometimes do extraordinarily wicked things
for the sake of what they consider the principles
of their party. Unfortunately for Philip he often
failed in his efforts; and the man who fails is
always in the wrong.</p>

<p>He was constantly at war, sometimes unsuccessfully,
often victoriously. Unlike Charles he did
not lead his armies in person, but sat at home and
prayed, read the crystal, and organized. After
the great battle of St. Quentin, in which he
defeated the French, he vowed to erect a mighty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
church to the glory of St. Lawrence which should
excel every other building in the world; and for
thirty years the whole available wealth of Spain
and the Indies was poured out on the erection
of the Escorial, which the Spaniards look upon as
the eighth wonder of the world, and who is to say
that they are wrong? Situated about twenty
miles from Madrid, in a bleak and desolate
mountain range, it reflects extraordinarily well
the character of the man who made it. Under
one almost incredible roof it combines a palace, a
university, a monastery, a church, and a mausoleum.
The weight of its keys alone is measured in
scores of pounds; the number of its windows and
its doors is counted in hundreds; it contains the
greatest works of many very great artists, and the
tombs of Charles V and his descendants. It
stands in lonely grandeur swept by constant bitter
winds, a fit monument for a lonely and morose
king. Its architecture is Doric, and stern as its
own granite.</p>

<p>The character of Philip II has been described
repeatedly, in England mainly by his enemies,
who have laid too much stress on his cruelty and
bigotry. Though he was fiercely religious, yet
he loved art and wrote poetry; though he would
burn a heretic as blithely as any man, yet he was a
kind husband to his four wives, whom he married<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
one after the other for political reasons; though
he was gloomy and austere, yet he loved music,
and was moved almost to tears by the sound of the
nightingale in the summer evenings of Spain. His
people loved him and affectionately called him
“Philip the prudent”; they forgave him his
mistakes, for they knew that he worked always for
the ancient religion which they loved, and for
the glory of Spain.</p>

<p>Unlike Charles his father, he was austere in his
mode of life, and always had a doctor at his side
at meals lest he should forget his gout. He was
a martyr to that most distressing complaint, no
doubt inherited from his father. He lived
abstemiously, but took too little exercise; it
would have been better for his health—and
probably for the world—had he followed his
armies on horseback like Charles, even if he had
recognized that he was no great general.</p>

<p>His death, at the age of seventy-two, was proud
and sombre, as befitted the son of the Empress
Isabel, who had scorned to cry when he was born.
We can understand a good deal about Philip
if we consider him as spiritually the son of that
proud sombre woman rather than of his glorious
and energetic father. In June, 1598, he was
attacked by an unusually severe attack of gout
which so crippled him that he could hardly move.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
He was carried from Madrid to the Escorial in a
litter, and was put to bed in a little room opening
off the church so that he could hear the friars at
their orisons. Soon he began to suffer from
“malignant tumours” all over his legs, which
ulcerated, and became intensely painful, so that
he could not bear even a wet cloth to be laid upon
them or to have the ulcers dressed. So he lay for
fifty-three days suffering frightful tortures, but
never uttering a word of complaint, even as his
mother had borne him in silence for the sake of
the great man who had begotten him. As the
ulcers could not be dressed, they naturally became
covered with vermin and smelled horribly.
Stoical in his agony, he called his son before him,
apologizing for doing so, but it was necessary.
“I want,” he said, “to show you how even the
greatest monarchies must end. The crown is
slipping from my head, and will soon rest upon
yours. In a few days I shall be nothing but a
corpse swathed in its winding-sheet, girdled with
a rope.” He showed no sign of emotionalism,
but retained his self-control to the last; after he
had said farewell to his son he considered that he
had left the world, and devoted the last few days
of his life to the offices of the church. The
monks in the church wanted to cease the continual
dirges and services, but he insisted that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
they should go on, saying: “The nearer I get
to the fountain, the more thirsty I become!”</p>

<p>These seem to have been his last words; he
appears to have retained consciousness as long as
may be.</p>

<p>Let us reason together and try if we can make
head or tail of this extraordinary illness. The
first certain fact about Philip II is that he long
suffered from gout, apparently the real old-fashioned
gout in the feet. In the well-known
picture of him receiving a deputation of Netherlanders,
as he sits in his tall hat beneath a crucifix,
it is perfectly evident that he is suffering tortures
from gout and wearing a large loosely fitting
slipper. These unfortunate gentlemen seem to
have selected a most unpropitious moment to ask
favours, for there is no ailment that so warps the
temper as gout. When a man suffers from gout
over a period of years it is only a matter of time
till his arteries and kidneys go wrong and he gets
arterio-sclerosis. We may take it, therefore, as
certain that at the age of seventy-two Philip had
sclerosed arteries and probably chronic Bright’s
disease like his father before him. Gout, Bright’s
disease, and high blood-pressure, are all strongly
hereditary, as every insurance doctor knows; that
is to say, the son of a father who has died of one
of these three is more likely than not to die<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
ultimately of some cognate disease of arteries or
kidneys or heart, all grouped together under the
name of cardio-vascular-renal disease.</p>

<p>But what about the “malignant tumours”?
“Malignant tumour” to-day means cancer of
one sort or another, and assuredly it was not
cancer that killed Philip. Probably the word
“tumour” simply meant “swelling.” Now,
what could these painful swellings have been
which ulcerated and smelt so horribly? Why
not gangrene? Ordinary senile gangrene, such
as occurs in arterio-sclerosis, neither causes
swellings, nor is it painful, nor does it smell nor
become verminous; but diabetic gangrene does all
these things. Diabetes in elderly people may go
on for many years undiscovered unless the urine be
chemically examined, and may only cause symptoms
when the arterio-sclerosis which generally
complicates it gives results, such as sudden death
from heart-failure, or diabetic gangrene. Thus
a very famous Australian statesman, who had been
known to have sugar in his urine for many years,
was one morning found dead in his bath, evidently
due to the high blood-pressure consequent on
diabetic arterio-sclerosis.</p>

<p>Diabetic gangrene often begins in some small
area of injured skin, such as might readily occur
in a foot tortured with gout; it ulcerates, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
exceedingly painful, and possessed of a stench
quite peculiar to its horrid self. It does not
confine itself to one foot, or to one area of a leg,
but suddenly appears in an apparently healthy
portion, having surreptitiously worked its way
along beneath the skin; its first sign is often a
painful swelling which ulcerates. The patient
dies either from toxæmia due to the gangrene,
or from diabetic coma; and fifty-three days is
not an unlikely period for the torture to continue.
On the whole it would seem that diabetic gangrene
appearing in a man who has arterio-sclerosis is a
probable explanation of Philip’s death. The
really interesting part of this historical diagnosis
is the way in which it explains his treatment of
the Netherlands. What justice could they have
received from a man tortured and rendered
petulant with gout and gloomy with diabetes?</p>

<p>Charles V had taken no care of himself, but had
gone roaring and fighting and guzzling and drinking
all over Europe; Philip had led a very quiet,
studious, and abstemious life, and therefore he
lived nearly twenty years longer than his father.
Possibly when he came to suffer the torments of
his death he may have thought the years not
worth his self-denial: possibly he may have
regretted that he did not have a good time when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
he was young, but this is not likely, for he was a
very conscientious man.</p>

<p>When Philip lay dying he held in his hand the
common little crucifix that his mother and father
had adored when they too had died; his friends
buried it upon his breast when they came to
inter him in the Escorial, where it still lies with
him in a coffin made of the timbers of the <i>Cinco
Chagas</i>, not the least glorious of his fighting
galleys.</p>

<p>Arterio-sclerosis, high blood-pressure, hyperpiesis,
and chronic Bright’s disease—all more or
less names for the same thing, or at any rate for
cognate disorders—form one of the great tragedies
of the world. They attack the very men whom we
can least spare; they are essentially the diseases of
statesmen. Although these diseases have been
attributed to many causes—that is to say, we do
not really know their true cause—it is certain
that worry has a great deal to do with them. If
a man be content to live the life of a cabbage, eat
little, and drink no alcohol, it is probable that he
will not suffer from high blood-pressure; but if
he is determined to work hard, live well, and yet
struggle furiously, then his arteries and kidneys
inevitably go wrong and he is not likely to stand
the strain for many years. Unless a politician has
an iron nerve and preternaturally calm nature, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
unless he is fortunate enough to be carried off
by pneumonia, then he is almost certain to die
of high blood-pressure if he persists in his politics.
I could name a dozen able politicians who have
fallen victims to their political anxieties. The
latest, so far as I know, was Mr. John Storey,
Premier of New South Wales, who died of high
blood-pressure in 1921; before him I remember
several able men whom the furious politics of
that State claimed as victims. In England Lord
Beaconsfield seems to have died of high blood-pressure,
and so did Mr. Joseph Chamberlain.
Mr. Gladstone was less fortunate, in that he
died of cancer. He must have possessed a calm
mind to go through his furious strugglings without
his kidneys or blood-vessels giving way; that,
and his singularly temperate and happy home-life,
preserved him from the usual fate of statesmen.</p>

<p>Charles V differed from Mr. Gladstone
because he habitually ate far too much, and could
never properly relax his mental tension. His
arterio-sclerosis had many results on history. It
was probably responsible for his extreme fits of
depression, in one of which it pleased Fate that
he should meet Barbara Blomberg. If he had
not been extraordinarily depressed and unhappy,
owing to his arterio-sclerosis, he would probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
not have troubled about her, and there would
have been no Don John of Austria. If he had
not had arterio-sclerosis he would probably not
have abdicated in 1556, when he should have had
many years of wise and useful activities before
him. If his judgment had not been warped by
his illness he would probably never have appointed
Philip II to be his successor as King of the Netherlands;
he would have seen that the Dutch were
not the sort of people to be ruled by an alien.
And if there had been no Don John it is possible
that there would have been no Don Quixote.
Once again, if Philip had not been eternally preoccupied
with his senseless struggle against the
Dutch, it is probable that he would have undertaken
his real duty—to protect Europe from the
Turk. When one considers how the lives of
Charles and his sons might have been altered
had his arteries been carrying a lower blood-tension,
it rather tends to alter the philosophy
of history to a medical man.</p>

<p>Again, when we consider that the destinies of
nations are commonly held in the hands of elderly
gentlemen whose blood-pressures tend to be too
high owing to their fierce political activities, it
is not too much to say that arterio-sclerosis is
one of the greatest tragedies that afflict the
human race. Every politician should have his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
blood-pressure tested and his urine examined
about once a quarter, and if it should show signs
of rising he should undoubtedly take a long rest
until it falls again; it is not fair that the lives of
millions should depend upon the judgment of a
man whose mind is warped by arterio-sclerosis.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Mr. and Mrs. Pepys</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SAMUEL PEPYS, Father of the Royal Navy,
and the one man—if indeed there were
any one man—who made possible the careers of
Blake and Nelson, died in 1703 in the odour of
the greatest respectability. Official London followed
him to his honoured grave, and he left
behind him the memory of a great and good
servant of the King in “perriwig” (alas, to
become too famous), stockings and silver buckles.
But unhappily for his reputation, though greatly
to the delight of a wicked world, he had, during
ten momentous years, kept a diary. It was
written in a kind of shorthand which he seems to
have flattered himself would not be interpreted;
but by some extraordinary mischance he had left
a key amongst his papers. Early in the nineteenth
century part of the Diary was translated, and a
part published. A staggered world asked for
more, and during the next three generations
further portions were made public, until by this
time nearly the whole has been published, and
it is unlikely that the small remaining portions
will ever see the light.</p>

<p>Pepys seems to have set down every thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
that came into his head as he wrote; things
which the ordinary man hardly admits to himself—even
supposing that he ever thinks or does
them—this stately Secretary of the Navy calmly
wrote in black and white with a garrulous
effrontery that absolutely disarms criticism. In
its extraordinary self-revelation the Diary is
unique; it is literally true that there is nothing
else like it in any other language, and it is almost
impossible that anything like it will ever be written
again; the man, the moment, and the occasion
can never recur. I take it that every man who
presumes to call himself educated has at least a
nodding acquaintance with this immortal work;
but a glance at some of its medical features may
be interesting. The difficulties at this end of the
world are considerable, because the Editor has
veiled some of the more interesting medical
passages in the decent obscurity of asterisks, and
one has to guess at some anatomical terms which,
if too Saxon to be printable in modern English,
might very well have been given in technical
Latin. Let us begin with a brief study of the
delightful woman who had the good fortune—or
otherwise—to be Pepys’s wife. Daughter of
a French immigrant and an Irish girl, Elizabeth
Pepys was married at fourteen, and her life ended,
after fifteen somewhat hectic years, in 1669, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
she was only twenty-nine years of age. Pepys
repeatedly tells us that she was pretty—and no
one was ever a better judge than he—and “very
good company when she is well.” Her portrait
shows her with a bright, clever little face, her
upper lip perhaps a trifle longer than the ideal,
bosom well developed, and a coquettish curl
allowed to hang over her forehead after the
fashion of the Court of Charles II. She spoke
and read French and English; she took the
keenest interest in life, and set to work to learn
from her husband arithmetic, “musique,” the
flageolet, use of the globes, and various accomplishments
which modern girls learn at school.
Mrs. Pepys imbibing all this erudition from her
husband, while her pretty little dog lies snoring
on the mat, forms a truly delightful picture, and
no doubt our imagination of it is no more delightful
than the reality was three hundred years ago.
I suppose it was the same dog as he whose puppyish
indiscretions had led to many a fierce quarrel
between husband and wife; Pepys always carefully
recorded these indiscretions, both of the
dog and, alas, of himself. It is clear that the
sanitary conveniences in Pepys’s house could not
have been up to his requirements.</p>

<p>Husband and wife went everywhere together,
and seem really to have loved each other; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
impression that I gather from Pepys’s exceedingly
candid description of her is that she was a loyal
and comradely wife, with a spirit of her own, and
a good deal to put up with; for though Pepys
was continually—and causelessly—jealous of her,
yet he did not hold that he was in any way bound
to be faithful to her on his own side. So they
pass through life, Pepys philandering with every
attractive woman who came his way, and Mrs.
Pepys dressing herself prettily, learning her little
accomplishments, squabbling with her maids,
and looking after her house and his meals, till
one day she engaged a servant, Deb Willet by
name, who brought a touch of tragedy into the
home. In November, 1668, Deb was combing
Pepys’s hair—no doubt in preparation for the
immortal “perriwig”—when Mrs. Pepys came
in and caught him “embracing her,” thus occasioning
“the greatest sorrow to me that ever I
knew in this world,” as he puts it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepys was “struck mute,” and was
silently furious. Outraged Juno towered over the
unhappy Pepys, and so to bed without a word,
nor slept all night; but about two in the morning
Juno became very woman; woke him up and told
him she had “turned Roman Catholique,” this
being, in the state of politics at that time, probably
the thing which she thought would hurt him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
more than anything else she could say. For the
next few days Pepys is sore troubled, and his
usual genial babble becomes almost incoherent.
The wrong dating and the expressions of
“phrenzy” show the mental agony that he
passed through, and there can be no doubt that
the joy of life passed out of him, probably never
more fully to return. The rest of the Diary is
written in a style graver than at first—some of it
is almost passionate. He describes with much
mental agitation how he woke up in the middle
of one night, and found his wife heating a pair of
tongs red-hot and preparing to pinch his nose;
gone for ever were the glad days when he could
pull her nose, and the “poor wretch” thought
none the worse of the lordly fellow. Twice had
he done so, and, as he says, “to offend.” One
would like to have Mrs. Pepys’s account of this
nose-pulling, and what she really thought of it.
Some people have found the struggle of Pepys
to cure himself of his infatuation for Deb
humorous; to any ordinarily sympathetic soul
who reads how he prayed on his knees in his own
room that God would give him strength never
again to be unfaithful, and how he appealed again
and again to his wife to forgive him, and how he,
to the best of his ability, avoided the girl, the
whole business becomes rather too painful to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
be funny, even though the unhappy man has the
art of making himself ridiculous in nearly every
sentence. Finally, in a fury of jealousy, she forced
him to write a most insulting letter to Miss
Willet, a letter that no woman could ever possibly
forgive, and Pepys’s life appears to have settled
down again. His sight failing him<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>—it is thought
that he suffered from hypermetropia combined
with early presbyopia—he abandoned the Diary
just at the time when one would have dearly
liked to hear more; and we never hear the end
either of Deb or of their married happiness.
Reading between the lines, one gathers that
probably Deb was more sinned against than
sinning, and that Mrs. Pepys had more real reason
to be angry about many women of whom she
had never heard than about the young woman
whose flirtation was the actual <i>casus belli</i>. It is
an unjust world. The two went abroad for a
six-months’ tour in France and Holland, and
immediately after they returned Mrs. Pepys fell
ill of a fever; for a time she appears to have
fought it well, but she took a bad turn and died.
Considering her youth, the season of the year,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
and that they had just returned from the Continent,
the disease was possibly typhoid. Pepys
erected an affectionate memorial to her, and was
later on buried by her side. He took the last
sacrament with her as she lay dying, so we may
reasonably suppose that she died having forgiven
him, and it is not unfair to imagine that the trip
abroad was a second honeymoon. They were
two grown-up children, playing with life as with
a new toy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepys was liable to attacks of boils in
asterisks; and a Dr. Williams acquired considerable
merit by supplying her with plasters and
ointments. On November 16, 1663, “Mr.
Hollyard came, and he and I about our great
work to look upon my wife’s malady, which he
did, and it seems her great conflux of humours
heretofore that did use to swell there did in
breaking leave a hollow which has since gone in
further and further till it is now three inches
deep, but as God will have it did not run into the
body-ward, but keeps to the outside of the skin,
and so he will be forced to cut open all along,
and which my heart will not serve me to see done,
and yet she will not have no one else to see it
done, no, not even her mayde, and so I must do
it poor wretch for her.” Pepys is in a panic
at the thought of assisting at the opening of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
subcutaneous abscess; one can feel the courage
oozing out at the palms of his hands as one reads
his agitated words. To his joy, next morning
Mr. Hollyard, on second thoughts, “believes a
fomentation will do as well, and what her mayde
will be able to do as well without knowing what
it is for, but only that it is for the piles.” Evidently
the “mayde’s” opinion was of some little
moment in Mrs. Pepys’s censorious world. Mr.
Pepys would have been much troubled to see
his wife cut before his face: “he could not have
borne to have seen it.” Mr. Hollyard received
£3 “for his work upon my wife, but whether it is
cured or not I cannot say, but he says it will
never come to anything, but it may ooze now and
again.” Mr. Hollyard was evidently easily satisfied.
Of course, there must have been a sinus
running in somewhere, but it is impossible to
guess at its origin. Possibly some pelvic sepsis;
possibly an ischio-rectal abscess. A long time
before he had noted that his wife was suffering
from a “soare belly,” which may possibly have
been the beginning of the trouble, but there is
no mention of any long and serious illness such
as usually accompanies para-metric sepsis. On
the whole, I fancy ischio-rectal abscess to be the
most likely explanation. Later on she suffers
from abscesses in the cheek, which “by God’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
mercy burst into the mouth, thus not spoiling
her face”; and she had constant trouble with
her teeth. It is thus quite probable that the
origin of the whole illness may have been pyorrhœa,
and no doubt this would go hard with her in the
fever from which she died. Possibly this may
have been septic pneumonia arising from septic
foci in the mouth; but, after all, it is idle to
speculate.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pepys never became pregnant during the
period covered by the Diary, though there were
one or two false alarms. There is no mention
of any continuous or constant ill-health, such as
we find in pyo-salpinx or severe tubal adhesions;
and such being the case, her sterility may quite
likely have been as much his fault as hers.</p>

<p>One cannot read the Diary without wishing
that we could have heard a little more of her side
of the questions that arose. What did she really
think of her husband when he pulled her nose?
Twice, too, no less! Stevenson calls her “a
vulgar woman.” Stevenson’s opinion on every
matter is worthy of the highest respect, as that
of a sensitive, refined, and artistic soul; but I
cannot help thinking that sometimes his early
Calvinistic training tended to make him rather
intolerant to human weakness. His judgment of
François Villon always seems to me intolerant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
and unjust, and he showed no sign in his novels
of ever having made any effort to comprehend
the difficulties and troubles which surround women
in their passage through the world. He understood
men—there can be no doubt of that; but
I doubt if he understood women even to the
small extent which is achieved by the average
man. Personally I find Mrs. Pepys far from
“vulgar”; generally she is simply delightful.
True, one cannot concur with her action over the
letter to Deb. It was cruel and ungenerous.
But she probably knew her husband well by that
time, and judged fairly accurately the only thing
that would be likely to bring him up with a round
turn, and again we have not the privilege of
knowing Deb except through Pepys’s possibly too
favourable eyes. Deb may have been all that
Mrs. Pepys thought her, and she may have
richly deserved what she got. After all, there is
in every woman protecting her husband from
the onslaughts of “vamps” not a little of the
wild-cat. Even the gentlest of women will
defend her husband—especially a husband who
retains so much of the boy as Pepys—from the
attempts of wicked women to steal him, poor
innocent love, from her sacred hearth; will defend
him with bare hands and claws, and totally regardless
of the rules of combat; and it is this touch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
of cattishness in Mrs. Pepys which makes one’s
heart warm towards her. For all we know Deb
Willet may have been a “vamp.” Mrs. Pepys
was certainly the “absolute female.”</p>

<p>Mr. Pepys suffered from stone in the bladder
before he began to keep a diary. He does not
appear to have been physically a hero; had he
been a general, no doubt he would have led his
army bravely from the rear except in case of a
retreat; but so great was the pain that he
submitted his body to the knife on March 26,
1658. Anæsthetics in those days were rudimentary,
relaxing rather than anæsthetizing the
patient. There is some reason to believe that
they were extensively used in the Middle Ages,
and contemporaries of Shakespeare seem to have
looked on their use as a matter of course; but
for some reason they became less popular, and
by the seventeenth century most people had to
undergo their operations with little assistance
beyond stout hearts and sluggish nervous systems.</p>

<p>Cutting for the stone was one of the earliest of
surgical operations. In ancient days it was first
done in India, and the glad news that stones
could be successfully removed from the living
body filtered through to the Greeks some centuries
before Christ. Hippocrates knew all about
it, and the operation is mentioned in that Hippocratic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
oath according to which some of us endeavour
to regulate our lives. At first it was only done
in children, because it was considered that adult
men would not heal properly, and the only result
in them would be a fistula. The child was held
on the lap of some muscular assistant, with one
or two not less muscular men holding its arms
and legs. The surgeon put one or two fingers
into the little anus and tried to push the stone
down on to the perineum, helped in this manœuvre
by hypogastric pressure from another assistant.
He then cut transversely above the anus,
strong in the faith that he might, if the gods
willed, open into the neck of the bladder. Next
he tried to push out the stone with his fingers
still in the anus; it is not quite clear whether
he would take his fingers out of the anus and
put them into the wound or vice versa; this
failing, he would seize the stone with forceps and
drag it through the perineum. As time went on
it was discovered that more than three or four
assistants could be employed, using others to sit
on the patient’s chest, thus adding the <i>peine
forte et dure</i> to the legitimate terrors of ancient
surgery and surrounding him with a mass of men.
Imbued with a spirit of unrest by the struggles
of the patient the mass swayed this way and that,
until it was discovered that by adding yet more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
valiants to the wings of the “scrum,” who should
answer heave with counter-heave, the resultant
of the opposing forces would hold even the
largest perineum steady enough for the surgeon
to operate; and men came under the knife for
stone. Next the patient was tied up with ropes,
somewhat in the style we used in our boyhood’s
sport of cock-fighting. What a piece of work is
the Rope! How perfect in all its works—from
the Pyramids—built with the aid of the
Rope and the Stick—to the execution of the latest
murderer. One might write pages on the influence
of the Rope on human progress; but for
our purpose we may simply say that probably
Mr. Pepys was kept quiet with many yards of
hemp. Those who cut for the stone were specialists,
doing nothing else; their arrival at a patient’s
house must have resembled an invasion, with their
vast armamentarium and crowds of assistants.
By Pepys’s time Marianus Sanctus had lived—yes,
so greatly was he venerated that they called
him “Sanctus,” the Holy Man; Saint Marianus
if you will. He it was, in Italy in 1524, who
invented the apparatus major, which made the
operation a little less barbarous than that of the
Greeks. This God-sent apparatus consisted
mainly of a grooved staff to be shoved into the
bladder and a series of forceps. You cut on to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
the staff as the first step of the operation; it
was believed that if you cut in the middle line
in the raphe the wound would never heal, owing
to the callosity of the part; moreover, if you
carried your incision too far back you would
cause fatal hæmorrhage from the inferior hæmorrhoidal
veins. Having, then, made your incision
well to the right or left, you exposed the urethra,
made a good big hole in that pipe, and inserted
a fine able pair of tongs, with which you seized
hold of the stone and crushed it if you could,
pulling it out in bits; or if the stone were hard,
and you had preternaturally long fingers, you
might even get it out on a finger-tip. It was
always considered the mark of a wise surgeon
to carry a spare stone with him in his waistcoat
pocket, so that the patient might at least have a
product of the chase to see if the surgeon should
find his normal efforts unrewarded. Diagnosis
was little more advanced in those days than
operative surgery; there are numbers of conditions
which may have caused symptoms like those
of a stone, and it was always well for the surgeon
to be prepared.</p>

<p>This would be the operation that was performed
on Mr. Pepys. The results in many cases were
disastrous; some men lost control of their
sphincter vesicæ; many were left with urinary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
fistulæ; in many the procreative power was
permanently destroyed by interference with the
seminal vesicles and ducts. Probably some of us
would prefer to keep our calculi rather than let
a mediæval stone-cutter perform upon us; we
are a degenerate crew. It is not altogether
displeasing to imagine the roars of the unhappy
Pepys, trussed and helpless, a pallid little Mrs.
Pepys quaking outside the door, perhaps not
entirely sorry that her own grievances were
being so adequately avenged, although the vengeance
was vicarious; while the surgeon wrestled
with a large uric acid calculus which could with
difficulty be dragged through the wound. It is
all very well for us to laugh at the forth-right
methods of our ancestors; but, considering their
difficulties—no anæsthesia, no antiseptics, want of
sufficient surgical practice, and the fact that
few could ever have had the hardness of heart
necessary to stand the patient’s bawlings, it is
remarkable that they did so well and that the
mortality of this appalling operation seems only
to have been from 15 to 20 per cent. Moreover
we may be pretty sure that no small stone would
ever be operated upon; men postponed the
operation until the discomfort became intolerable.
It remained for the genius of Cheselden, when
Pepys was dead and possibly in heaven some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
twenty years, to devise the operation of lateral
lithotomy, one of the greatest advances ever
made in surgery. This operation survived practically
unchanged till recent times.</p>

<p>Pepys’s heroism was not in vain, and was
rewarded by a long life free from serious illness
till the end. March 26 became to him a holy
day, and was kept up with pomp for many years.
The people of the house wherein he had suffered
and been strong were invited to a solemn feast
on that blessed day, and as the baked meats went
round and the good wine glowed in the decanters,
Mr. Pepys stood at his cheer and once again
recounted the tale of his agony and his courage.
Nowadays, when we are operated upon with
little more anxiety than we should display over
signing a lease, it is difficult to imagine a state
of things such as must have been inevitable in
the days before Simpson and Lister.</p>

<p>The stone re-formed, but not in the bladder.
Once you have a uric acid calculus you can never
be quite sure you have done with it until you
are dead, and in the case of Mr. Pepys recurrence
took place in the kidney. When he died,
an old man, in 1703, they performed a post-mortem
examination on his body, suspecting that
his kidneys were at fault, and in the left kidney
found a nest of no less than seven stones, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
must have been silently growing in the calyces
for unnumbered years. Nor does it seem to me
impossible that his extraordinary incontinence—he
never seems to have been able to resist any
feminine allurement, however coarse—may really
have been due to the continued irritation of the
old scar in his perineum. There is often a
physical condition as the basis for this type of
character, and some trifling irritation may make
all the difference between virtue and concupiscence.
This reasoning is probably more likely
to be true than much of the psycho-analysis
which is at present so fashionable among young
ladies. Possibly also the sterility of Mrs. Pepys
may have been partly due to the effects of the
operation upon her husband.</p>

<p>One unpleasant result to Mr. Pepys was the
fact that whenever he crossed his legs carelessly
he became afflicted with a mild epididymitis—he
describes it much less politely himself, doubtless
in wrath. His little failing in this respect must
have been a source of innocent merriment to
the many friends who were in the secret. He
was also troubled with attacks of severe pain
whenever the weather turned suddenly cold.
At first he used to be in terror lest his old enemy
had returned, but he learned to regard the attacks
philosophically as part of the common heritage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
of mankind, for man is born to trouble as the
sparks fly upward. Probably they were due to
reflex irritation from the stones growing in the
kidney. He does not seem to have passed any
small stones per urethram, or he would assuredly
have told us. He took great interest in his own
emunctories—probably other people’s, too, from
certain dark sayings.</p>

<p>Considering the by no means holy living of
Mr. Pepys, it is rather remarkable that he never
seems to have suffered from venereal disease,
and this leads me to suspect that possibly these
ailments were not so common in the England of
the Restoration as they are to-day. It seems
impossible that any man could live in Sydney so
promiscuously as Mr. Pepys without paying the
penalty; and the experience of our army in
London seems to show that things there must
be much the same as here (Sydney). I often
wonder whether Charles II and his courtiers were
really representative of the great mass of people
in England at that time; probably the prevalence
of venereal disease in modern times is due to the
enormous increase in city life; probably men
and women have always been very much the same
from generation to generation—inflammable as
straw, given the opportunities which occur
mainly in cities and crowded houses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>Ignoble as was Pepys, he yet showed real moral
courage during the Plague. When that great
enemy of cities attacked London he, very wisely,
sent his family into the country at Woolwich,
while he remained faithful to his duty and
continued to work at the navy in Greenwich,
Deptford, and London. I cannot find in the
Diary any mention of any particular attraction
that kept him in London during those awful
five months; he would, no doubt, have mentioned
her name if there had been such; yet candour
compels me to observe that there was seldom any
one attraction for Mr. Pepys, unless poor Deb
Willet may have somehow mastered—temporarily—his
wayward heart. But, as might have
been expected, he was little more virtuous during
his wife’s absence than before; indeed, possibly
the imminent danger of death may have led him
to enjoy his life while yet he might, with his
usual fits of agonized remorse, whose effects upon
his conduct were brief. We owe far more to
his organizing power and honesty—not a bigoted
variety—than is generally remembered. His
babble is not the best medium for vigorous
description, and you will not get from Pepys any
idea of the epidemic comparable with that which
you will get from the journalist Defoe; yet
through those months there lurks a feeling of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
horror which still impresses mankind. The
momentary glimpse of a citizen who stumbles over
the “corps” of a man dead of the plague, and
running home tells his pregnant wife; she dies
of fear forthwith; a man, his wife, and three
children dying and being buried on one day;
persons quick to-day and dead to-morrow—not
in scores, but in hundreds; ten thousand dying
in a week; the horrid atmosphere of fear and
suspicion which overlay London; and Pepys
himself setting his papers in order, so that men
might think well of him should it please the Lord
to take him suddenly: all give us a sense of doom
all the more poignant because recently we went
through a much milder version of the same
experience ourselves. The papers talked glibly
of the influenza as “The Plague.” How different
it was from the real bubonic plague is shown by
the statistics. In five months of 1665 there died
of the plague in the little London of that day
no less than about 70,000 people, according to
the bills of mortality; in truth, probably far
more; that is to say, probably a fifth of the
people perished. There is no doubt that the
bubonic plague kept back the development of
cities, and therefore of civilization, for centuries,
and that the partial conquest of the rat has been
one of the greatest achievements of the human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
race. What is happening in Lord Howe Island,
where it is exceedingly doubtful whether rats or
men shall survive in that beautiful speck of land,
shows how slender is the hold which mankind
has upon the earth; and wherever the rat is able
to breed unchecked, man is liable to sink back
into savagery. The rat, the tubercle bacillus, and
the bacillus of typhoid are the three great enemies
of civilization; we hold our position against them
at the price of eternal vigilance, and probably
the rat is not the least deadly of these enemies.</p>

<p>I need not go through the Diary in search of
incidents; most of them, while intensely amusing,
are rather of interest to the psychologist in the
study of self-revelation than to the medical man.
When Pepys’s brother lay dying the doctor in
charge hinted that possibly the trouble might
have been of syphilitic origin; Pepys was virtuously
wrathful, and the unhappy doctor had to
apologize and was forthwith discharged. I cannot
here narrate how they proved that the
unhappy patient had never had syphilis in his
life; you must read the Diary for that. Their
method would not have satisfied either Wassermann
or Bordet. Another time Pepys was doing
something that he should not have been doing at
an open window in a draught; the Lord punished
him by striking him with Bell’s palsy. Still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
again, at another time he got something that
seems to have resembled pseudo-ileus, possibly
reflex from his latent calculi. Everybody in the
street was much distressed at his anguish; all the
ladies sent in prescriptions for enemata; the one
which relieved him consisted of small beer!
Indeed, one marvels always at the extraordinary
interest shown by Pepys’s lady-friends in his most
private ailments. London must have been a
friendly little town in the seventeenth century,
in the intervals of hanging people and chopping
off heads.</p>

<p>But the great problem remains: Why did
Pepys write down all these intimate details of his
private life? Why did he confess to things which
most men do not confess even to themselves?
Why did he write it all down in cypher? Why,
when he narrated something particularly disgraceful,
did he write in a mongrel dialect of bad
French, Italian, Spanish, and Latin? He could
not have seriously believed that a person who was
able to read the Diary would not be able to read
the very simple foreign words with which it is
interspersed. Most amazing of all: Why did he
keep the manuscript for more than thirty years, a
key with it? One thinks of the fabled ostrich
who buries his head in the sand. The problem
of Pepys still remains unsolved, in spite of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
efforts of Stevenson in <i>Familiar Studies of Men
and Books</i>. Stevenson was the last man in the
world to understand Pepys, but more competent
exegetists have tried and failed. One can only
say that his failing sight—which Professor Osborne
of Melbourne attributes to astigmatism—has
deprived the world of a treasure that can never
be sufficiently regretted. No man can be considered
educated who has not read at least part
of the Diary; in no other way is it possible to get
so vivid a picture of the ordinary people of a
past age; as we read they seem to live before us,
and it comes as a shock to remember that poor
Pall Pepys—his plain sister—and “my wife”
and Mrs. Batelier—“my pretty valentine”—and
Sir William Coventry and Mercer, and the
hundreds more who pass so vividly before us, are
all dead these centuries.</p>

<p>If this little paper shall send some to the
reading of this most extraordinary book, I shall
be more than satisfied. The only edition which
is worth while is Wheatley’s, in ten volumes,
with portraits and a volume of <i>Pepysiana</i>. The
smaller editions are apt to transmute Pepys
into an ordinary humdrum and industrious civil
servant.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Edward Gibbon</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR many years it has been taught—I have
taught it myself to generations of students—that
Gibbon’s hydrocele surpassed in greatness
all other hydroceles, that it contained twelve
pints of fluid, and that it was, in short, one of
those monstrous things which exist mainly in
romance; one of those chimeras which grow in
the minds of the half-informed and of those who
wish to be deceived. For a brief moment this
chimera looms its huge bulk over serious history;
it is pricked; it disappears for ever, carrying with
it into the shades the greatest of historians, perhaps
the greatest of English prose writers. What
do we really know about it?</p>

<p>The first hint of trouble given by the hydrocele
occurs in a letter by Gibbon to his friend Lord
Sheffield. It is so delicious, so typical of the
eighteenth century, of which Gibbon himself
was probably the most typical representative,
that I cannot resist re-telling it. Two days
before, he has hinted to his friend that he was
rather unwell; now he modestly draws the veil.
“Have you never observed, through my inexpressibles,
a large prominency <i>circa genitalia</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
which, as it was not very painful and very little
troublesome, I had strangely neglected for many
years?” “A large prominency <i>circa genitalia</i>”
is a variation on the “lump in me privits, doctor,”
to which we are more accustomed. Gibbon’s is
the more graceful, and reminds us of the mind
which had described chivalry as the “worship
of God and the ladies”; the courteous and urbane
turn of speech which refuses to call a spade a spade
lest some polite ear may be offended.</p>

<p>Gibbon had been staying at Sheffield House
in the preceding June—the letter was written
in November—and his friends all noted that “Mr.
G.” had become strangely loath to take exercise
and very inert in his movements. Indeed, he
had detained the house-party in the house during
lovely days together while he had orated to them
on the folly of unnecessary exertion; and such
was his charm that every one, both women as
well as men, seems to have cheerfully given up
the glorious English June weather to keep him
company. Never was he more brilliant—never
a more delightful companion; yet all the time
he was like the Spartan boy and the wolf, for he
knew of his secret trouble, yet he thought that
no one else suspected. It is an instance of how
little we see ourselves as others see us that this
supremely able man, who could see as far into a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
millstone as anyone, lived for years with a hydrocele
that reached below his knees while he wore
the tight breeches of the eighteenth century and
was in the fond delusion that nobody else knew
anything about it. Of course, everybody knew;
probably it had been the cause of secret merriment
among all his acquaintance; when the tragedy
came to its last act it turned out that every one
had been talking about it all the time, and that
they had thought it to be a rupture about which
Mr. Gibbon had of course taken advice.</p>

<p>After leaving Sheffield House the hydrocele
suddenly increased, as Gibbon himself says, “most
stupendously”; and it began to dawn upon him
that it “ought to be diminished.” So he called
upon Dr. Walter Farquhar; and Dr. Farquhar
was very serious and called in Dr. Cline, “a surgeon
of the first eminence,” both of whom “viewed
it and palped it” and pronounced it a hydrocele.
Mr. Gibbon, with his usual good sense and calm
mind, prepared to face the necessary “operation”
and a future prospect of wearing a truss which
Dr. Cline intended to order for him. In the
meantime he was to crawl about with some
labour and “much indecency,” and he prayed
Lord Sheffield to “varnish the business to the
ladies, yet I am much afraid it will become
public,” as if anything could any longer conceal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
the existence of this monstrous chimera. It is
hardly credible, but Gibbon had had the hydrocele
since 1761—thirty-two years—yet had never
even hinted of it to Lord Sheffield, with whom
he had probably discussed every other fact
connected with his life; and had even forbidden
his valet to mention it in his presence or to anyone
else. Gibbon, the historian who, more than
any other, set Reason and Common Sense on their
thrones, seems to have been ashamed of his hydrocele.
Once more we wonder how little even able
men may perceive the truth of things! In 1761
he had consulted Cæsar Hawkins, who apparently
had not been able to make up his mind whether
it was a hernia or a hydrocele. In 1787 Lord
Sheffield had noticed a sudden great increase in
the size of the thing; and in 1793, as we have
seen, it came to tragedy.</p>

<p>He was tapped for the hydrocele on November
14; four quarts of fluid were removed, the swelling
was diminished to nearly half its size, and the
remaining part was a “soft irregular mass.”
Evidently there was more there than a simple
hydrocele, and straightway it began to refill so
rapidly that they had to agree to re-tap it in a
fortnight. Mr. Cline must have felt anxious;
he would know “how many beans make five”
well enough, and his patient was the most distinguished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
man in the world. Many students
who have at examinations in clinical surgery
wrestled with Cline’s splint will probably consider
that Cline’s punishment for inventing that
weapon really began on the day when he perceived
Gibbon’s hydrocele to be rapidly re-filling.
The fortnight passed, and the second tapping took
place, “much longer, more searching, and more
painful” than before, though only three quarts
of fluid were removed; yet Mr. Gibbon said he
was much more relieved than by the first attempt.
Thence he went to stay with Lord Auckland at a
place called Eden Farm; thence again to Sheffield
House. There, in the dear house which to him
was a home, he was more brilliant than ever
before. It was his “swan song.” A few days
later he was in great pain and moved with difficulty,
the swelling again increased enormously,
inflammation set in, and he became fevered, and
his friends insisted on his return to London. He
returned in January, 1794, reaching his chambers
after a night of agony in the coach; and Cline
again tapped him on January 13. By this time
the tumour was enormous, ulcerated and inflamed,
and Cline got away six quarts. On January 15 he
felt fairly well except for an occasional pain in his
stomach, and he told some of his friends that he
thought he might probably live for twenty years.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
That night he had great pain, and got his valet
to apply hot napkins to his abdomen; he felt that
he wished to vomit. At four in the morning his
pain became much easier, and at eight he was
able to rise unaided; but by nine he was glad
to get back into bed, although he felt, as he said,
<i>plus adroit</i> than he had felt for months. By
eleven he was speechless and obviously dying,
and by 1 p.m. he was dead.</p>

<p>I believe that the key to this extraordinary
and confused narrative is to be found in the visit
to Cæsar Hawkins thirty years before, when
that competent surgeon was unable to satisfy
himself as to whether he was dealing with a
rupture or a hydrocele. It seems now clear that
in reality it was both; and Gibbon, who was a
corpulent man with a pendulous abdomen,
lived for thirty years without taking care of it.
But he lived very quietly; he took no exercise;
he was a man of calm, placid, and unruffled mind;
probably no man was less likely to be incommoded
by a hernia, especially if the sac had a large wide
mouth and the contents were mainly fat. But
the time came when the intra-abdominal pressure
of the growing omentum became too great, and
the swelling enormously increased, first in 1787
and again in 1793. When Cline first tapped the
swelling he was obviously aware that there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
more present than a hydrocele, because he warned
Gibbon that he would have to wear a truss afterwards,
and moreover, though he removed four
quarts of fluid, yet the swelling was only reduced
by a half. Probably the soft irregular mass
which he then left behind was simply omentum
which had come down from the abdomen. But
why did the swelling begin to grow again immediately?
That is not the usual way with a
hydrocele, whose growth and everything connected
with it are usually indolently leisurely.
Could there have been a malignant tumour in
course of formation? But if so, would not that
have caused more trouble? Nor would it have
given the impression of being a soft irregular
mass. However, the second tapping was longer
and more painful than the first, though it removed
less fluid; and Gibbon was more relieved. But
this tapping was followed by inflammation. What
had happened? Possibly Cline had found the
epididymis; more probably his trochar was
septic, like all other instruments of that pre-antiseptic
period; at all events, the thing went
from bad to worse, grew enormously, and severe
constitutional symptoms set in. The ulceration
and redness of the skin, which was no doubt
filthy enough—surgically speaking—after thirty
years of hydrocele, look uncommonly like suppurative<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
epididymitis, or suppuration in the
hydrocele. Thus Gibbon goes on for a few days,
able to move about, though with difficulty, till
he cheers up and seems to be recovering; then
falls the axe, and he dies a few hours after saying
that he thought he had a good chance of living
for twenty years.</p>

<p>Could the great septic hydrocele, connected
with the abdomen through the inguinal ring, have
suddenly burst its bonds and flooded the peritoneum
with streptococci? Streptococcic peritonitis
is one of the most appalling diseases in
surgery. Its symptoms to begin with are vague,
and it spreads with the rapidity of a grass fire in
summer. After an abdominal section the patient
suddenly feels exceedingly weak, there is a little
lazy vomiting, the abdomen becomes distended,
the pulse goes to pieces in a few hours, and death
occurs rapidly while the mind is yet clear. The
surgeon usually calls it “shock,” or thinks in his
own heart that his assistant is a careless fellow;
but the real truth is that streptococci have somehow
been introduced into the abdomen and
have slain the patient without giving time for
the formation of adhesions whereby they might
have been shut off and ultimately destroyed.
That is what I believe happened to Edward
Gibbon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>The loss to literature through this untimely
tragedy was, of course, irreparable. Gibbon had
taken twenty years to mature his unrivalled
literary art. His style was the result of unremitting
labour and exquisite literary taste; if one
accustoms oneself to the constant antitheses—which
occasionally give the impression of being
forced almost more for the sake of dramatic
emphasis than truth—one must be struck with
the unvarying majesty and haunting music of the
diction, illumined by an irony so sly, so subtle—possibly
a trifle malicious—that one simmers
with joyous appreciation in the reading. That
sort of irony is more appreciated by the onlookers
than by its victims, and it is not to be marvelled
at that religious people felt deeply aggrieved for
many years at the application of it to the Early
Christians. Yet, after all, what Gibbon did was
nothing more than to show them as men like
others; he merely showed that the evidence
concerning the beginnings of Christendom was
less reliable than the Church had supposed. The
<i>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</i> shows the
history of the world for more than a thousand
years, so vividly, so dramatically, that the characters—who
are great nations—move on the stage
like actors, and the men who led them live in a
remarkable flood of living light. The general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
effect upon the reader is as if he were comfortably
seated in a moving balloon traversing over Time
as over continents; as if he were seated in Mr.
Wells’s “Time Machine,” viewing the disordered
beginnings of modern civilization. I believe that
no serious flaw in Gibbon’s history has been found,
from the point of view of accuracy. Some
people have found it too much a <i>chronique scandaleuse</i>,
and some modern historians appear to
consider that history should be written in a dull
and pedantic style rather than be made to live;
furthermore, the great advance in knowledge of
the Slavonic peoples has tended to modify some
of his conclusions. Nevertheless, Gibbon remains,
and so far as we can see, will ever remain, the
greatest of historians. Though we might not
have had another <i>Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire</i>, yet we might reasonably have looked for
the completion of that autobiography which had
such a brilliant beginning. What would we not
give if that cool and appraising mind, which
had raised Justinian and Belisarius from the dead
and caused them to live again in the hearts of
mankind, could have given its impressions of the
momentous period in which it came to maturity?
If, instead of England receiving its strongest
impression of the French Revolution from Carlyle—whose
powers of declamation were more potent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
than his sense of truth—it had been swayed from
the beginning by Gibbon? In such a case the
history of modern England—possibly of modern
Russia—might have been widely different from
what we have already seen.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Jean Paul Marat</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT has always been the pride of the medical
profession that its aim is to benefit mankind;
but opinions may differ as to how far this aim was
fulfilled by one of our most eminent confrères,
Jean Paul Marat. He was born in Neufchatel
of a marriage between a Sardinian man and a
Swiss woman, and studied medicine at Bordeaux;
thence, after a time at Paris, he went to London,
and for some years practised there. In London
he published <i>A Philosophical Essay on Man</i>,
wherein he showed enormous knowledge of the
English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish
philosophers; and advanced the thesis that a
knowledge of science was necessary for eminence
as a philosopher. By this essay he fell foul of
Voltaire, who answered him tartly that nobody
objected to his opinions, but that at least he
might learn to express them more politely,
especially when dealing with men of greater
brains than his own.</p>

<p>The French Revolution was threatening; the
coming storm was already thundering, when, in
1788, Marat’s ill-balanced mind led him to
abandon medicine and take to politics. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
returned to Paris, beginning the newspaper <i>L’Ami
du Peuple</i>, which he continued to edit till late
in 1792. His policy was simple, and touched
the great heart of the people. “Whatsoever
things were pure, whatsoever things were of good
repute, whatsoever things were honest”—so be
it that they were not Jean Paul Marat’s, those
things he vilified. He suspected everybody, and
constantly cried, “Nous sommes trahis”—that
battle-cry of Marat which remained the battle-cry
of Paris from that day to 1914. By his
violent attacks on every one he made Paris too
hot to hold him, and once again retired to London.
Later he returned to Paris, apparently at the
request of men who desired to use his literary
skill and violent doctrines; he had to hide in
cellars and sewers, where it was said he contracted
that loathsome skin disease which was henceforth
to make his life intolerable, and to force him to
spend much of his time in a hot-water bath, and
would have shortly killed him only for the intervention
of Charlotte Corday. In these haunts
he was attended only by Simonne Everard, whose
loyalty goes to show either that there was some
good even in Marat, or that there is no man so
frightful but that some woman may be found
to love him. Finally, he was elected to the
Convention, and took his seat. There he continued<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
his violent attacks upon everybody, urging
that the “gangrene” of the aristocracy and bourgeoisie
should be amputated from the State.
His ideas of political economy appear to have
foreshadowed those of Karl Marx—that the
proletariat should possess everything, and that
nobody else should possess anything. Daily
increasing numbers of heads should fall in the
sacred names of Liberty, Fraternity, and Equality.
At first a mere 600 would have satisfied him, but
the number rapidly increased, first to 10,000,
then to 260,000. To this number he appeared
faithful, for he seldom exceeded it; his most
glorious vision was only of killing 300,000 daily.</p>

<p>He devoted his energies to attacking those
who appeared abler and better than himself, and
the most prominent object of his hatred was the
party of the Girondins. These were so called
because most of them came from the Gironde,
and they are best described as people who wished
that France should be governed by a sane and
moderate democracy, such as they wrongly
imagined the Roman Republic to have been.
They were gentle and clever visionaries, who
dreamed dreams; they advised, but did not dare
to perform; the most famous names which have
survived are those of Brissot, Roland, and Barbaroux.
Madame Roland, who has become of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
legendary fame, was considered their “soul”;
concerning her, shouts Carlyle: “Radiant with
enthusiasm are those dark eyes, is that strong
Minerva-face, looking dignity and earnest joy;
joyfullest she where all are joyful. Reader,
mark that queen-like burgher-woman; beautiful,
Amazonian-graceful to the eye; more so to the
mind. Unconscious of her worth (as all worth
is), of her greatness, of her crystal-clearness,
genuine, the creature of Sincerity and Nature,
in an age of Artificiality, Pollution and Cant”—and
so forth. But Carlyle was writing prose-poetry,
sacrificing truth to effect, and it is unwise
to take his poetical descriptions as accurate.
Recent researches have shown that possibly
Manon Roland was not so pure, honest, and well-intentioned
as Carlyle thought—nor so “crystal-clear.”
Summed up, the Girondins represented
the middle classes, and the battle was now set
between them and the “unwashed,” led by
Robespierre, Danton, and Marat.</p>

<p>What manner of man, then, was this Marat,
physically? Extraordinary! Semi-human from
most accounts. Says Carlyle: “O Marat, thou
remarkablest horse-leech, once in d’Artois’
stable, as thy bleared soul looks forth through thy
bleared, dull-acrid, woe-stricken face, what seest
thou in all this?” Again: “One most squalidest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
bleared mortal, redolent of soot and horse-drugs.”
There appears to have been a certain
amount of foundation for the lie that Marat had
been nothing more than a horse-doctor, for once
when he was brevet-surgeon to the bodyguard
of the Compte d’Artois he had found that he
could not make a living, and had been driven to
dispense medicines for men and horses; his
enemies afterwards said that he had never been
anything more than a horse-leech. Let us not
deprive our own profession of one of its ornaments.
His admirer Panis said that while Marat
was hiding in the cellars, “he remained for
six weeks on one buttock in a dungeon”;
immediately, therefore, he was likened to St.
Simeon Stylites, who, outside Antioch, built
himself a high column, repaired him to the top,
and stood there bowing and glorifying God for
thirty years, until he became covered with sores.
Dr. Moore gives the best description of him.
“Marat is a little man of a cadaverous complexion,
and countenance exceedingly expressive
of his disposition; to a painter of massacres
Marat’s head would be invaluable. Such heads
are rare in this country (England), yet they are
sometimes to be met with in the Old Bailey.”
Marat’s head was enormous; he was less than
five feet high, with shrivelled limbs and yellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
face; one eye was higher placed than the other,
“so that he looked lop-sided.” As for his skin disease,
modern writers seem to consider that we
should nowadays call it “dermatitis herpetiformis,”
though his political friends artlessly thought
it was due to the humours generated by excessive
patriotism in so small a body attacking his skin,
and thus should be counted for a virtue. Carlyle
hints that it was syphilis, thus following in the
easy track of those who attribute to syphilis
those things which they cannot understand. But
syphilis, even if painful, would not have been
relieved by sitting for hours daily in a hot bath.</p>

<p>Mentally he appears to have been a paranoiac,
to quote a recent historical diagnosis by Dr.
Charles W. Burr, of Philadelphia. Marat suffered
for many years from delusions of persecution,
which some people appear to take at their face
value; the <i>New Age Encyclopedia</i> specially
remarks on the amount of persecution that he
endured—probably all delusional, unless we are
to consider the natural efforts of people in self-defence
to be persecution. He suffered from
tremendous and persistent “ego-mania,” and
appears to have believed that he had a greater
intellect than Voltaire. Marat, whom the mass
of mankind regarded with horror, fancied himself
a popular physician, whom crowds would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
have consulted but for the unreasonable and
successful hatred of his enemies. Possibly failure
at his profession, combined with the unspeakable
irritation of his disease, may have embittered his
mind, and for the last few months of his life
there can be little doubt that Marat was insane.</p>

<p>It seems to be certain that he organized, if he
did not originate, the frightful September massacres.
There were many hundreds of Royalists
in the prisons, who were becoming a nuisance.
The Revolution was hanging fire, and well-meaning
enthusiasts began to fear that the dull clod
of a populace would not rise in its might to end
the aristocracy; so it was decided to abolish
these unfortunate prisoners. A tribunal was
formed to sit in judgment; outside waited a
great crowd of murderers hired for the occasion.
The prisoners were led before the
tribunal, and released into the street, where
they were received by the murderers and were
duly “released”—from this sorrowful world.
The most famous victim was the good and gentle
Princess de Lamballe, Superintendent of the
Queen’s Household. The judge at her trial was
the notorious Hébert, anarchist, atheist, and
savage, afterwards executed by his friend Robespierre
when he had served his turn. Madame<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
collapsed with terror, and fainted repeatedly
during the mockery of a trial, but when Hébert
said the usual ironical, “Let Madame be released,”
she walked to the door. When she saw
the murderers with their bloody swords she
shrank back and shrieked, “Fi—horreur.” They
cut her in pieces; but decency forbids that I
should say what they did with all the pieces.
Carlyle, who here speaks truth, has a dark saying
about “obscene horrors with moustachio <i>grands-levres</i>,”
which is near enough for anatomists to
understand. The murderers then stuck her head
on a pike, and held her fair curls before the
Queen’s window as an oriflamme in the name of
Liberty. Madame was but one of 1,100 whose
insane butchery must be laid to the door of Marat;
though some friends of the Bolsheviks endeavour
to acquit him we can only say that if it was not
his work it looks uncommonly like it.</p>

<p>The battle between the Girondins, who were
bad fellows, but less bad than their enemies of
the “Mountain”—Robespierre, Danton, and
Marat—continued; it was a case of <i>arcades ambo</i>,
which Bryon translates “blackguards both,”
though Virgil, who wrote the line—in the
Georgics—probably meant something much
coarser. The “Mountain” began to get the
upper hand, and the Girondins fled for their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
lives, or went to the guillotine. The Revolution
was already “devouring its children.”</p>

<p>At Caen in Normandy there lived a young
woman, daughter of a decayed noble family
which in happier days had been named d’Armont,
now Corday. Her name was Marie Charlotte
d’Armont, and she is known to history as Charlotte
Corday. She had been well educated, had read
Rousseau, Voltaire, and the encyclopædists, besides
being fascinated by a dream of an imaginary
State which she had been taught to call the
Roman Republic, in which the “tyrannicide”
Brutus loomed much larger and more glorious
than in reality. Some Girondists fled to Caen
to escape the vengeance of Marat; Charlotte,
horrified, resolved that the monster should die;
she herself was then nearly twenty-five years of
age. I have a picture of her which seems to fit
in very well with one’s preconceived ideas of her
character. She was five feet one inch in height,
with a well-proportioned figure, and she had a
wonderful mass of chestnut hair; her eyes were
large, grey, and set widely apart; the general
expression of her face was thoughtful and earnest.
Perhaps it would hardly be respectful to call her
an “intense” young lady; but there was a young
lady who sometimes used to consult me who
might very well have sat for the portrait; she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
possessed a type of somewhat—dare I say?—priggish
neurosis which I imagine was not unlike
the type of character that dwelt within Charlotte
Corday—extreme conscientiousness and self-righteousness.
Such a face might have been the
face of a Christian martyr going to the lions—if
any Christian martyrs were ever thrown to the
lions, which some doubt. She went silently to
Paris, attended only by an aged man-servant, and
bought a long knife in the Palais Royal; thence
she went to Marat’s house, and tried to procure
admission. Simonne—the loyal Simonne—denied
her, and she returned to her inn. Again
she called at the house; Marat heard her pretty
voice, and ordered Simonne to admit her. It
was the evening of July 13, four years all but
one day since the storming of the Bastille, and
Marat sat in his slipper-bath, pens, ink, and paper
before him, frightful head peering out of the
opening, hot compresses concealing his hair.
Charlotte told him that there were several
Girondists hiding at Caen and plotting against
the Revolution. “Their heads shall fall within
a fortnight,” croaked Marat. Then, he being
thus convicted out of his own mouth, she drew
forth from her bosom her long knife, and plunged
it into his chest between the first and second ribs,
so that it pierced the aorta. Marat gave one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
cry, and died; Charlotte turned to face the two
women who rushed in, but not yet was she to
surrender, for she barricaded herself behind some
furniture and other movables till the soldiers
arrived. To them she gave herself up without
trouble.</p>

<p>At her trial she made no denial, but proudly
confessed, saying, “Yes, I killed him.” Fouquier-Tinville
sneered at her: “You must be well
practised at this sort of crime!” She only
answered: “The monster!—he seems to think I
am an assassin!” She thought herself rather
the agent of God, sent by Him to rid the world
of a loathsome disorder, as Brutus had rid Rome
of Julius Cæsar.</p>

<p>In due course she was guillotined, and an
extraordinary thing happened. A young German
named Adam Lux had been present at the trial,
standing behind the artist who was painting the
very picture of which I have a reproduction—it
is said that Charlotte showed no objection to
being portrayed—and the young man had been
fascinated by the martyresque air of her. He
attended the execution, romance and grief weighing
him down; then he ran home, and wrote a
furious onslaught on the leaders of the Mountain
who had executed her, saying that her death had
“sanctified the guillotine,” and that it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
become “a sacred altar from which every taint
had been removed by her innocent blood.” He
published this broadcast, and was naturally at
once arrested. The revolutionary tribunal sentenced
him to death, and he scornfully refused to
accept a pardon, saying that he wished to die on
the same spot as Charlotte, so they let him have
his wish. The incident reminds one of a picture-show,
and it is not remarkable that an American,
named Lyndsay Orr, has written a sentimental
article about it.</p>

<p>The people of Paris went mad after Marat’s
death; his body, which was said to be decaying
with unusual rapidity, was surrounded by a great
crowd which worshipped it blasphemously,
saying, “O Sacred Heart of Marat!” This
worship of Marat, which showed how deeply
his teaching had bitten into the hearts of the
people, culminated in the Reign of Terror,
which began on September 5, 1795, whereby
France lost, according to different estimates,
between half a million and a million innocent
people. Some superior persons seem to think
that Marat had little or no influence on the
Revolution, but to my mind there can be no
doubt that the Terror was largely the result of
his preaching of frantic violence, and it is a lesson
that we ourselves should take to heart, seeing that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
there are persons in the world to-day who would
emulate Marat if they possessed his enormous
courage.</p>

<p>I need not narrate the history of the Reign of
Terror, which was even worse than the terror
which the Bolsheviks established in Russia. Not
even Lenin and Trotsky devised anything so
atrocious as the <i>noyades</i>—wholesale drownings—in
the Loire, or the <i>mariages républicains</i> on the
banks of that river, and it is difficult to believe
that the teaching of Marat had nothing to do
with that frightful outbreak of bestiality, lust,
and murder.</p>

<p>The evil that men do lives after them. There
was little good to be buried in Marat’s grave,
doctor though he was.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Napoleon I</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE is not, and may possibly never be, an
adequate biography of this prodigious man.
It is a truism to say that he has cast a doubt on
all past glory; let us hope that he has rendered
future glory impossible, for to judge by the
late war it seems impossible that any rival to the
glory of Napoleon can ever arise. In the matter
of slaying his fellow-creatures he appears to have
reached the summit of human achievement;
possibly also in all matters of organization and
administration. Material things hardly seemed
to affect him; bestriding the world like a colossus
he has given us a sublime instance of Intellect that
for many years ruthlessly overmastered Circumstance.
That Intellect was finally itself mastered
by disease, leaving behind it a record which is of
supreme interest to mankind; a record which,
alas, is so disfigured by prejudice and falsehood
that it is difficult to distinguish between what is
true and what is untrue. Napoleon himself
possessed so extraordinary a personality that
nearly every one whom he met became a fervent
adorer. With regard to him we can find no
half-tones, no detached reporters; therefore it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
is enormously difficult to find even the basis for
a biography. Fortunately, that is not now our
province. It is merely necessary that we shall
attempt to make a consistent story of the reports
of illness which perplex us in regard to his life
and death; it adds interest to the quest when
we are told that sometimes disease lent its aid to
Fate in swaying the destinies of battles. And yet,
even after Napoleon has lived, there are some
historians who deny the influence of a “great
man” upon history, and would attribute to
“tendencies” and “ideas” events which ordinary
people would attribute to individual genius.
Some persons think that Napoleon was merely
an episode—that he had no real influence upon
history; it is the custom to point to his career
as an exemplification of the thesis that war has
played very little real part in the moulding of the
course of the world. Into all this we need not
now enter, beyond saying that he was the “child
of the French Revolution” who killed his own
spiritual father; the reaction from Napoleon
was Metternich, Castlereagh, and the Holy
Alliance; the reaction from these forces of repression
was the late war. So it is difficult to agree
that Napoleon was only an “episode.” We
have merely to remark that he was the most
interesting of all men, and, so far as we can tell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
will probably remain so. As Fielding long ago
pointed out in <i>Jonathan Wild</i>, a man’s “greatness”
appears to depend on his homicidal capacity.
To make yourself a hero all you have to do is
to slaughter as many of your fellow-creatures
as God will permit. How poor the figures of
Woodrow Wilson or Judge Hughes seem beside
the grey-coated “little corporal”! Though it is
quite probable that either of these most estimable
American peacemakers have done more good for
the human race than was achieved by any
warrior! So sinful is man that we throw our
hats in the air and whoop for Napoleon the
slaughterer, rather than for Woodrow Wilson,
who was “too proud to fight.”</p>

<p>When Napoleon was sent to St. Helena he was
followed by a very few faithful friends, who seem
to have spent their time in hating one another
rather than in comforting their fallen idol. It
is difficult to get at the truth of these last few
years because, though most of the eye-witnesses
have published their memoirs, each man seems to
have been more concerned to assure the world of
the greatness of his own sacrifice than to record
the exact facts. Therefore, though Napoleon
urged them to keep diaries, and thereby make
great sums of money through their imprisonment,
yet these diaries generally seem to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
aimed rather at attacking the other faithful ones
than at telling us exactly what happened.</p>

<p>The post-mortem examination of Napoleon’s
body was performed by Francesco Antommarchi,
a young Corsican physician, anatomist, and
pathologist, who was sent to St. Helena about
eighteen months before Napoleon’s death in the
hope that he, being a Corsican, would be able
to win the Emperor’s confidence and cure the
illness of which he was already complaining.
Unfortunately, Antommarchi was a very young
man, and Napoleon suspected both his medical
skill and the reason of his presence. Napoleon
used to suffer from severe pains in his stomach;
he would clasp himself, and groan, “O, mon
pylore!” By that time he was suffering from
cancer of the stomach, and Antommarchi did
not suspect it. When Napoleon groaned and
writhed in agony it is said that Antommarchi
merely laughed, and prescribed him tartar emetic
in lemonade. Napoleon was violently sick, and
thought himself poisoned; he swore he would
never again taste any of Antommarchi’s medicine.
Once again Antommarchi attempted to give him
tartar emetic in lemonade; it was not in vain
that Napoleon had won a reputation for being a
great strategist, for, when Antommarchi’s back
was turned he handed the draught to the unsuspecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
Montholon. In ten minutes that hero
reacted in the usual manner, and extremely
violently. Napoleon was horrified and outraged
in his feelings; quite naturally he accused
Antommarchi of trying to poison him, called him
“assassin,” and refused to see him again. Another
fault that Napoleon found with the unhappy
young man was that whenever he wanted medical
attendance Antommarchi was not to be found,
but had to be ferreted out from Jamestown,
three and a half miles away; so altogether
Antommarchi’s attendance could not be called
a success. Napoleon in his wrath was “terrible
as an army with banners.” Even at St. Helena,
where the resources of the whole world had been
expended in the effort to cage him helpless, it
must have been no joke to stand up before those
awful eyes, that scorching tongue; and it is
no wonder that Antommarchi preferred to spend
the last few weeks idling about Jamestown rather
than forcing unwelcome attention upon his
terrible patient.</p>

<p>Worst of all, Antommarchi at first persuaded
himself that Napoleon’s last illness was not
serious. When Napoleon cried in his agony,
“O, mon pylore!” and complained of a pain that
shot through him like a knife, Antommarchi
merely laughed and turned to his antimony with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
catastrophic results. It shakes our faith in
Antommarchi’s professional skill to read that
until the very last moment he would not believe
that there was much the matter. The veriest
blockhead—one would imagine—must have seen
that the Emperor was seriously ill. Many a
case of cancer of the stomach has been mistaken
for simple dyspepsia in its early stages, but there
comes a time when the true nature of the disease
forces itself upon even the most casual observer.
The rapid wasting, the cachexia, the vomiting,
the pain, all impress themselves upon both
patient and friends, and it is difficult to avoid
the conclusion that Antommarchi must have
been both careless and negligent. When the
inevitable happened, and Napoleon died, it was
Antommarchi who performed the autopsy, and
found a condition which it is charitable to suppose
may have masked the last symptoms and
may have explained, if it did not excuse, the
young anatomist’s mistaken confidence.</p>

<p>We conclude our brief sketch of the unhappy
Antommarchi by saying that when he returned
to Europe he published the least accurate and
most disingenuous of all accounts of Napoleon’s
last days. His object seems to have been rather
to conceal his own shortcomings than to tell
the truth. This book sets the seal on his character,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
and casts doubt on all else that comes from his
pen. He may have been, as the <i>Lancet</i> says,
a “trained and competent pathologist”; he
was certainly a most unfortunate young man.</p>

<p>The post-mortem was performed in the presence
of several British military surgeons, who
appear to have been true sons of John Bull, with
all the prejudice, ignorance, and cocksureness
that in the eyes of other nations distinguish us
so splendidly. Though truthfulness was not a
strong point with Antommarchi, he seems to
have known his pathology, and has left us an
exceedingly good and well-written report of what
he found. Strange to relate, the body was
found to be still covered thickly with a superficial
layer of fat, and the heart and omenta were
also adipose. This would seem impossible in
the body of a man who had just died from cancer
of the stomach, but is corroborated by a report
from a Dr. Henry, who was also present, and is
not unknown. I remember the case of an old
woman who, though hardly at all wasted, was
found at the autopsy to have an extensive cancerous
growth of the pylorus; the explanation was
that the disease had been so acute that it slew
her before there had been time to produce much
wasting. At one point Napoleon’s cancerous
ulcer had perforated the stomach, and the orifice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
had been sealed by adhesions. Dr. Henry
proudly states that he himself was able to thrust
his finger through it. The liver was large but
not diseased; the spleen was large and “full of
blood”—probably Antommarchi meant engorged.
The intestine was covered by small bright-red
patches, evidently showing inflammation of lymphatic
tissue such as frequently occurs in general
infections of the body. The bladder contained
gravel and several definite calculi. There was
hardly any secondary cancerous development,
except for a few enlarged glands. Antommarchi
and the French generally had diagnosed before
death that he was suffering from some sort of
hepatitis endemic to St. Helena, and the cancer
was a great surprise to them—not that it would
have mattered much from the point of view of
treatment.</p>

<p>Napoleon’s hands and feet were extremely
small; his skin was white and delicate; his body
had feminine characteristics, such as wide hips
and narrow shoulders; his reproductive organs
were small and apparently atrophied. He is said
to have been impotent for some time before
he died. There was little hair on the body, and
the hair of the head was fine, silky, and sparse.
Twenty years later his body was exhumed and
taken to France, and Dr. Guillard, who was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
permitted to make a brief examination, stated
that the beard and nails appeared to have grown
since death; there was very little sign of decomposition;
men who had known him in life recognized
his face immediately it was uncovered.</p>

<p>Leonard Guthrie points out that some of these
signs seem to indicate a condition of hypo-pituitarism—the
opposite to the condition of
hyper-pituitarism which causes “giantism.” Far-fetched
as this theory may appear, yet it is
possible that there may be something in it.</p>

<p>The autopsy showed beyond cavil that the
cause of death was cancer of the stomach, and
it is difficult to see what more Antommarchi
could have done in the way of treatment than
he did, although certainly an irritant poison like
tartar emetic would not have been good for a
man with cancer of the stomach, even if it did
not actually shorten his life. But Napoleon was
not a good patient. He had seen too much of
army surgery to have a great respect for our
profession; indeed, it is probable that he had
no respect for anybody but the Emperor Napoleon.
He, at least, knew his business. He could
manœuvre a great army in the field and win
battles—and lose them too. But even a lost
Napoleonic battle—there were not many—was
better managed than a victory of any other man;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
whereas when you were dealing with these doctor
fellows you could never tell whether their
results were caused by their treatment or by
the intervention of whatever gods there be.
Decidedly Antommarchi was the last man in the
world to be sent to treat the fallen, but still
imperious, warrior.</p>

<p>The symptoms of impending death seem to
have been masked by a continued fever, and
probably Antommarchi was not really much to
blame. This idea is to some extent borne out
by a couple of specimens in the Museum of the
Royal College of Surgeons, which are said to have
belonged to the body of Napoleon. The story
is that they were surreptitiously removed by
Antommarchi, and handed by him to Barry
O’Meara, who in his turn gave them to Sir
Astley Cooper. That baronet handed them to
the museum, where they are now preserved as
of doubtful origin. But their genuineness depends
upon whether we can believe that Antommarchi
would or could have removed them, and
whether O’Meara was telling the truth to Sir
Astley Cooper. It is doubtful which of the two
first-mentioned men is the less credible, and
Cooper could not have known how untruthful
O’Meara was to show himself, or he would probably
not have thought for one moment that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
specimens were genuine. O’Meara was a contentious
Irishman who, like most other people, had
fallen under the sway of Napoleon’s personal
charm. He published a book in which he libelled
Sir Hudson Lowe, whose hard fate it was to be
Napoleon’s jailer at St. Helena—that isle of
unrest. For some reason Lowe never took
action against his traducer until it was too late,
so that his own character, like most things connected
with Napoleon, still remains a bone of
contention. But O’Meara had definitely put
himself on the side of the French against the
English, and it was the object of the French to
show that their demigod had died of some illness
endemic to that devil’s island, aggravated by the
barbarous ill-treatment of the brutal British. We
on our side contended that St. Helena was a
sort of earthly paradise, where one should live
for ever. The fragments are from <i>somebody’s</i>
ileum, and show little raised patches of inflamed
lymphoid tissue; Sir William Leishman considers
the post-mortem findings, apart from the
cancer, those of some long-continued fever, such
as Mediterranean fever.</p>

<p>Mediterranean or Malta fever is a curious
specific fever due to the <i>Micrococcus melitensis</i>,
which shows itself by recurrent bouts of pyrexia,
accompanied by constipation, chronic anæmia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
and wasting. Between the bouts the patient
may appear perfectly well. There are three
types—the “undulatory” here described; the
“intermittent,” in which the attacks come on
almost daily; and the “malignant,” in which
the patient only lives for a week or ten days.
It is now known to be contracted by drinking the
infected milk of goats, and it is almost confined to
the shores of the Mediterranean and certain parts
of India. It may last for years, and it is quite
possible that Napoleon caught it at Elba, of which
Mediterranean island he was the unwilling
emperor in 1814. Thence he returned to
France, as it was said, because he had not elba-room
on his little kingdom. It is certain that
for years he had been subject to feverish attacks,
which army surgeons would now possibly classify
as “P.U.O.,” and it is quite possible that these
may in reality have been manifestations of Malta
fever.</p>

<p>It has been surmised by some enthusiasts that
the frequency of micturition, followed by dysuria,
to which he was liable, may have really been due
to hyper-pituitarism. Whenever we do not
understand a thing let us blame a ductless gland;
the pituitary body is well hidden beneath the
brain, and its action is still not thoroughly
understood. But surely we need no further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
explanation of this miserable symptom than the
stones in the bladder. Napoleon for many
years might almost be said to have lived on
horseback, and riding is the very thing to cause
untold misery to a man afflicted with vesical
calculus. Dysuria, attendant upon frequency of
micturition, is a most suggestive symptom; nowadays
we are always taught to consider the possibility
of stone, and it is rather surprising that
nobody seems to have suspected it during his
lifetime. This could be very well accounted for
by remembering the general ignorance and incompetence
of army surgeons at the time, the mighty
position of the patient, and his intolerance of the
medical profession. Few men would have dared
to suggest that it would be well for him to submit
to the passage of a sound, even if the trouble ever
became sufficiently urgent to compel him to
confide so private a matter to one so lowly as a
mere army doctor. Yet he had known and
admired Baron Larrey, the great military surgeon
of the Napoleonic Wars; one can only surmise
that his calculi did not give him much trouble,
or that they grew more rapidly in the sedentary
life which he had led at St. Helena.</p>

<p>During the last year or so he took great interest
in gardening, and spent hours in planting trees,
digging the soil, and generally behaving somewhat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
after the manner of a suburban householder.
He was intensely bored by his forced inaction,
and used to take refuge in chess. His staff at
first welcomed this, but unhappily they could find
nobody bad enough for the mighty strategist to
beat; yet nobody dared to give him checkmate,
and it was necessary to lose the game foolishly
rather than to defeat Napoleon. It is clear that
the qualities requisite in a good chess-player are
by no means the same as those necessary to
outmanœuvre an army.</p>

<p>Throughout his life his pulse-rate seldom
exceeded fifty per minute; as he grew older he
was subject to increasing lassitude; his extremities
felt constantly chilly, and he used to lie for
hours daily in hot-water baths. Possibly these
may have been symptoms of hypo-pituitarism;
Lord Rosebery follows popular opinion in
attributing his laziness to the weakening effects
of hot baths. Occasionally Napoleon suffered
from attacks of vomiting, followed by fits of
extreme lethargy. It is quite possible that these
vomiting attacks may have been due to the
gastric ulcer, which must have been growing for
years until, about September, 1820, it became
acutely malignant.</p>

<p>The legend that Napoleon suffered from
epilepsy appears, according to Dr. Ireland, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
rest upon a statement in Talleyrand’s memoirs.
In September, 1805, in Talleyrand’s presence,
Napoleon was seized after dinner with a sort of
fit, and fell to the ground struggling convulsively.
Talleyrand loosened his cravat, obeying the
popular rule in such circumstances to “give him
air.” Remusat, the chief chamberlain, gave him
water, which he drank. Talleyrand returned to
the charge, and “inundated” him with eau-de-Cologne.
The Emperor awakened, and said
something—one would like to know what he said
when he felt the inundation streaming down his
clothes—probably something truly of the camp.
Half an hour later he was on the road that was
to lead him—to Austerlitz, of all places! Clearly
this fit, whatever it may have been, was not
epilepsy in the ordinary sense of the term.
There was no “cry,” no biting of the tongue,
no foaming at the mouth, and apparently no
unconsciousness. Moreover, epilepsy is accompanied
by degeneration of the intellect, and
nobody dares to say that Austerlitz, Jena, and
Wagram—to say nothing of Aspern and Eckmuhl—were
won by a degenerate. Eylau and Friedland
were also to come after 1805, and these seven
names still ring like a trumpet for sheer glory,
daring, and supreme genius. I suppose there is
not one of them—except perhaps Aspern—which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
would not have made an imperishable name for
any lesser general. It is impossible to believe
that they were fought by an epileptic. If
Napoleon really had epilepsy it was assuredly not
the “<i>grand mal</i>” which helps to fill our asylums.
It is just possible that “<i>petit mal</i>” may have
been in the picture. This is a curious condition
which manifests itself by momentary loss of
consciousness; the patient may become suddenly
dreamy and purposeless, and may perform curious
involuntary actions—even crimes—while <i>apparently</i>
conscious. When he recovers he knows
nothing about what he has been doing, and may
even resume the interrupted action which had
occupied him at the moment of the seizure.
Some such explanation may account for Napoleon’s
fits of furious passion, that seem to have
been followed by periods of lethargy and vomiting.
It is a sort of pleasing paradox—and mankind
dearly loves paradox—to say that supremely
great men suffer from epilepsy. It was said of
Julius Cæsar, of St. Paul, and of Mohammed.
These men are said to have suffered from “falling
sickness,” whatever that may have been; there
are plenty of conditions which may make men
fall to the ground, without being epileptic:
Ménière’s disease, for instance. It is ridiculous
to suppose that Julius Cæsar and Napoleon—by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
common consent the two greatest of the sons
of men—should have been subject to a disease
which deteriorates the intellect.</p>

<p>It is possible that some such trouble as “<i>petit
mal</i>” may have been at the bottom of the curious
stories of a certain listless torpor that appears
to have overcome Napoleon at critical moments
in his later battles. Something of the kind
happened at Borodino in 1812, the bloodiest and
most frightful battle in history till that time.
Napoleon indeed won, in the sense that the
exhausted Russians retreated to Moscow, whither
he pursued them to his ill-fortune; but the
battle was not fought with anything like the
supreme genius which he displayed in his other
campaigns. Similarly, he is said to have been
thus stricken helpless after Ligny, when he
defeated Blucher in 1815. He wasted precious
hours in lethargy, which should have been spent
in his usual furious pursuit of his beaten foe.
To this day the French hold that, but for Napoleon’s
inexplicable idleness after Ligny, there
would have been no St. Helena; and, with all
the respect due to Wellington and his thin red
line, it is by no means certain that the French
are wrong. But nations will continue to squabble
about Waterloo till there shall be no more war;
and 1814 had been the most brilliant of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
campaigns—probably of any man’s campaigns.</p>

<p>“Of woman came the beginning of sin, and
through her therefore we all die,” said the
ungallant author of Ecclesiasticus; and it is
certain that Napoleon was extremely susceptible
to feminine charms. Like a Roman emperor, he
had but to cast a glance at a woman and she was
at his feet. Yet probably his life was not very
much less moral than was customary among the
great at that time. When we remember his
extraordinary personal charm, it is rather a
matter for wonder that women seem to have had
so little serious effect upon his life, and he seems
to have taken comparatively little advantage of
his opportunities. His first wife, Josephine Beauharnais,
was a flighty Creole who pleased herself
entirely; in the vulgar phrase, she “took her
pleasure where she found it.” To this Napoleon
appears to have been complaisant, but as she
could not produce an heir to the dynasty which
he wished to found, he divorced her, and married
the Austrian princess Marie Louise, whose father
he had defeated and humiliated as few sovereigns
have ever been humiliated. She deserted him
without a qualm when he was sent to Elba;
when he was finally imprisoned at St. Helena
there was no question of her following him, even
if the British Government had had sufficient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
imagination to permit such a thing. Napoleon,
who was fond of her, wanted her to go with him;
but one could not expect a Government containing
Castlereagh, Liverpool, and Bathurst, to show
any sympathy to the fallen foe who had been a
nightmare to Europe for twenty years. She
would never consent to see Josephine. It is
said that Napoleon’s <i>libido sexualis</i> was violent,
but rapidly quelled. In conversation at St.
Helena he admitted having possessed seven mistresses;
of them he said simply, “C’est beaucoup.”
When he was sent to St. Helena his mother wrote
and asked to be allowed to follow him; however
great a man’s fall, his mother never deserts him,
and asylum doctors find that long after the wife
or sisters forget some demented and bestial
creature, his mother loyally continues her visits
till the grave closes over one or the other. But
more remarkable is the fact that Pauline Bonaparte,
who was always looked upon as a shameless
hussy, would have followed him to St. Helena,
only that she was ill in bed at the time. She was
the beautiful sister who sat to Canova for the
statue of Venus in the Villa Borghese. It was
then thought most shocking for a lady of high
degree to be sculptured as a nude Venus—perhaps
it is now; I say, <i>perhaps</i>. There are few ladies
of high degree so beautiful as Princess Pauline,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
as Canova shows her. A friend said to her about
the statue, “Were you not uncomfortable,
princess, sitting there without any clothes on?”
“Uncomfortable,” said Princess Pauline, “why
should I be uncomfortable? There was a stove
in the room!” There are many other still less
creditable stories told about her. It was poor
beautiful Pauline who lost her husband of yellow
fever, herself recovering of an attack at the same
time. She cut off her hair and buried it in his
coffin. This was thought a wonderful instance
of wifely devotion, until the cynical Emperor
remarked: “Quite so; quite so; of course, she
knows it will grow again better than ever for
cutting it off, and that it would have fallen off
anyhow after the fever.” Yet when he was sent
to Elba, this frivolous sister followed him, and
she sold every jewel she possessed to make life
comfortable for him at St. Helena. She was a
very human and beautiful woman, this Pauline;
she detested Marie Louise, and once in 1810 at a
grand fête she saucily poked out her tongue at
the young Empress in full view of all the nobles.
Unhappily Napoleon saw her, and cast upon her
a dreadful look; Pauline picked up her skirts and
ran headlong from the room. When she heard of
his death she wept bitterly; she died four years
afterwards of cancer. Her last action was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
call for a mirror, looking into which she died,
saying, “I am still beautiful; I am not afraid to
die.”</p>

<p>In attempting to judge Marie Louise it must
be remembered that there is a horrid story told
of Napoleon’s first meeting with her in France
after the civil marriage had been performed by
proxy in Vienna. It is said that the fury of his
lust did her physical injury, and that that is the
true reason why she never forgave him and deserted
him at the first opportunity. She bore him a
son, of whom he was passionately fond, but after
his downfall the son—the poor little King of
Rome immortalized by Rostand in “<i>l’Aiglon</i>”—fell
into the hands of Metternich, the Austrian,
who is said to have deliberately contrived to have
him taught improper practices, lest he should
grow up to be as terrible a menace to the world
as his father. But all these are rumours, and
show how difficult it is to ascertain the truth of
anything connected with Napoleon.</p>

<p>When Napoleon fell to the dust after Leipzig,
Marie Louise became too friendly with Count von
Neipperg, whom she morganatically married after
Napoleon’s death. Although he heard of her
infidelity, he forgave her, and mentioned her
affectionately in his will, thereby showing, to
borrow a famous phrase of Gibbon about Belisarius,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
“Either less or more than the character
of a man.”</p>

<p>For nine days before he died he lay unconscious
and babbled in delirium. On the morning of
May 5, 1821, Montholon thought he heard the
words “<i>France ... armée ... tête d’armée.</i>”
The dying Emperor thrust Montholon from his
side, struggled out of bed, and staggered towards
the window. Montholon overpowered him and
put him back to bed, where he lay silent and
motionless till he died the same evening. The
man who had fought about sixty pitched battles,
all of which he had won, I believe, but two—who
had caused the deaths of three millions of his own
men and untold millions of his enemies—died as
peacefully in his bed as any humble labourer.
What dim memories passed through his clouded
brain as he tried to say “head of the army”?
A great tropical storm was threatening Longwood.
Did he recall the famous “sun of Austerlitz”
beneath whose rays the <i>grande armée</i> had elevated
its idolized head to the highest pitch of earthly
glory? Who can follow the queer paths taken
by associated ideas in the human brain?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Benvenuto Cellini</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NO one can read Benvenuto’s extraordinary
autobiography without being reminded
of the even more extraordinary diary of Mr.
Pepys. But there is one very great difference.
Cellini dictated his memoirs to a little boy for
the world at large, and did not profess to tell the
whole truth—rather those things which came
into his mind readily in his old age; but Pepys
wrote for himself in secret cypher in his own
study, and the reason of his writing has never
yet been guessed. Why did he set down all his
most private affairs? And when they became
too disgraceful even for Mr. Pepys’s conscience,
why did he set them down in a mongrel mixture
of French and Spanish? Can we find a hint
in the fact that he left a key to the cypher
behind him? Did he really wish his Diary to
remain unreadable for ever? Was it really
a quaint and beastly vanity that moved
him?</p>

<p>But Cellini wrote <i>per medium</i> of a little boy
amanuensis while he himself worked, and possibly
he may have deliberately omitted some facts
too shameful for the ears of that <i>puer ingenuus</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
though I have my doubts about this theory.
He frankly depicts himself as a cynical and forth-right
fellow always ready to brawl; untroubled
by conventional ideas either of art or of morality;
ready to call a spade a spade or any number of
adjectived shovels that came instantly to his
mind. If it be great writing to express one’s
meaning tersely, directly, and positively, then
Cellini’s is the greatest of writing, though we
have to be thankful that it is in a foreign language.
The best translation is probably that of John
Addington Symonds—a cheaper and excellent
edition is published in the <i>Everyman Library</i>—and
nobody who wishes to write precisely as he
thinks can afford to go without studying this
remarkable book. And having studied it he
will probably come to the conclusion that there
are other things in writing than merely to express
oneself directly. There is such a thing as
beauty of thought as well as beauty of expression;
and probably he will end by wondering
what is that thing which we call beauty?
Is it only Truth, as even such a master of
Beauty as Keats seems to have thought? Why
is one line of the <i>Grecian Urn</i> more beautiful
than all the blood and thunder of Benvenuto?</p>

<p>Cellini says that he caught the “French evil”—i.e.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
syphilis—when he was a young man; he
certainly did his best to catch it. His symptoms
were abnormal, and the doctors assured him
that his disease was not the “French evil.”
However, he knew better, and assumed a treatment
of his own, consisting of <i>lignum vitæ</i> and
a holiday shooting in the marshes. Here he
probably caught malaria, of which he cured himself
with guaiacum. We know now that, alas,
syphilis cannot be cured by such means; and
the fact that he lived to old age seems to show
that there was something wrong with his diagnosis.
I have known plenty of syphilitics who
have reached extreme old age, but they had not
been cured by <i>lignum vitæ</i> and a holiday; it was
mercury that had cured them, taken early and
often, over long periods. I very much doubt
whether he ever had the “French evil” at
all.</p>

PERSEUS AND THE GORGON’S HEAD.<br />

Statue by Benvenuto Cellini (Florence, Loggia de’ Lanzi).</p>

<p>But apart from this and from his amazing
revelations of quarrelling and loose living, the
autobiography is worth reading for its remarkable
description of the casting of his great statue of
Perseus, which now stands in the Loggia dei
Lanzi at Florence hard by the Uffizi. By the
time the book had reached so far the little boy
had long wearied of the job of secretary, and
the old man had buckled down to the labour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
of writing with his own hand. I dare swear that
he wrote this particular section at one breath,
so to speak; the torrent of words, poured forth
in wild excitement, carry the reader away with
the frenzy of the writer as Benvenuto recalls the
greatest hours of his life. Nowhere is such an
instance of the terrible labour pains of a true
artist as his offspring comes to birth.</p>

<p>The great statue does more than represent
Perseus; it represents the wild and headlong
mind of Benvenuto himself. Perseus stands
in triumph with the Gorgon’s head in one hand
and a sword in the other. You can buy paper-knives
modelled on this sword for five lire in
Florence to-day. The gladness and youthful
joy of Perseus are even more striking than those
of Verrochio’s David in the Bargello just near
at hand. Verrochio has modelled a young
rascal of a Jew who is clearly saying: “Alone
I did it; and very nice too!” Never was
boyish triumph better portrayed. But Benvenuto’s
Perseus is a great young man who has
done something very worthy, and knows that it
is worthy. He has begun to amputate the head
very carefully with a neat circular incision round
the neck; then, his rage or his fear of the basilisk
glance getting the better of him, he has set his
foot against the Gorgon’s shoulder and tugged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
at the head violently until the grisly thing has
come away in his hand, tearing through the soft
parts of the neck and wrenching the great vessels
from the heart.</p>

<p>As is well known, opportunities for performing
decapitation upon a Gorgon are few; apart from
the rarity of the monster there is always the risk
lest the surgeon may be frozen stiff in the midst
of the operation; and it becomes still more
difficult when it has to be performed in the
Fourth Dimension through a looking-glass. We
have the authority of <i>The Mikado</i> that self-decapitation
is a difficult, not to say painful,
operation, and Benvenuto could not have practised
his method before a shaving-mirror, because
he had a bushy beard, though some of us have
inadvertently tried in our extreme youth before
we have learned the advisability of using safety
razors. Anyhow, Benvenuto’s Perseus is a very
realistic, violent, and wonderful piece of sculpture;
if he had done nothing else he would have still
been one of the greatest artists in the world.
My own misfortune was in going to Florence
before I had seriously read his autobiography;
I wish to warn others lest that misfortune should
befall them. Read Cellini’s autobiography—<i>then</i>,
go to Florence! You will see how the
author of the autobiography was the only man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
who could possibly have done the Perseus; how,
in modelling the old pre-hellenic demigod, he
was really modelling his own subconscious
mind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">Death</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WHEN William Dunbar sang, “Timor mortis
perturbat me,” he but expressed the
most universal of human—perhaps of animate—feelings.
It is no shame to fear death; the
fear appears to be a necessary condition of our
existence. The shame begins when we allow
that fear to influence us in the performance
of our duty. But why should we fear death
at all? It is hardly an explanation to say that
the fear of death is implanted in living things
lest the individual should be too easily slain
and thereby the species become extinct. Who
implanted it? And why is it so necessary
that that individual should survive? Why is
it necessary that the species should survive?
And so on—to name only a few of the unanswerable
questions that crowd upon us whenever
we sit down to muse upon that problem
which every living thing must some time have
a chance of solving. The question of death
is inextricably bound up with the interpretation
of innumerable abstract nouns, such as truth,
justice, good, evil, and many more, which all
religions make some effort to interpret. Philosophy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>
attempts it by the light of man’s reason;
religion by a light from some extra-human
source; but all alike represent the struggles of
earnest men to solve the insoluble.</p>

<p>Nor is it possible to obtain help from the great
men of the past, because not one of them knew
any more about death than you do yourself.
Socrates, in Plato’s <i>Phædo</i>, Sir Thomas Browne
in the <i>Religio Medici</i> and the <i>Hydriotaphia</i>,
Shakespeare in <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>Macbeth</i> and many
other plays, St. Paul in various epistles, all tried
to console us for the fact that we must die;
the revolt against that inevitable end of beauty
and ugliness, charm and horror, love and hate,
is the most persistent note in literature; and
there are few men who go through life without
permitting themselves to wonder, “What is
going to happen to me? Why should I have to
die? What will my wife and children do after
me? How is it possible that the world will go
on, and apparently go on just the same as now,
for ages after an important thing like me is
shovelled away into a hole in the ground?” I
suppose you have dreamed with a start of horror a
dream in which you revisit the world, and looking
for your own house and children, find them
going along happily and apparently prosperous,
the milkman coming as usual, a woman in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
form of your wife ordering meals and supervising
household affairs, the tax-gatherer calling—let
us hope a little less often than when you were
alive—the trams running and the ferry-boats
packed as usual, and the sun shining, the rain
falling sometimes, Members of Parliament bawling
foolishly over nothing—all these things
happening as usual; but you look around to see
anybody resembling that beautiful and god-like
creature whom you remember as yourself, and
wheresoever you look he is not there. Where
is he? How can the world possibly go on
without him? Is it really going on, or is it
nothing more than an incredible dream? And
why are you so shocked and horror-stricken by
this dream? You could hardly be more shocked
if you saw you wife toiling in a garret for the
minimum wage, or your children running about
barefoot selling newspapers. The shocking fact
is not that you have left them penniless, but that
you have had to leave them at all. In the morning
joy cometh as usual, and you go cheerfully
about your work, which simply consists of postponing
the day of somebody else’s death as long
as you can. For a little time perhaps you will
take particular note of the facts which accompany
the act of death; then you will resign yourself
to the inevitable, and continue doggedly to wage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
an endless battle in which you must inevitably
lose, assured of nothing but that some day you
too will lie pallid, your jaw dropped, your chest
not moving, your face horribly inert; and that
somebody will come and wash your body and
tie up your jaw and put pennies on your eyes
and wrap you in cerements and lift you into
a long box; and that large men will put the box
on their shoulders and lump you into a big
vehicle with black horses, and another man will
ironically shout Paul’s words, “O death, where
is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?”
And in the club some man will take your seat
at lunch, and the others will say you were a
decent sort of fellow and will not joke loudly
for a whole meal-time. And ten years hence
who will remember you? Your wife and children,
of course—if they too have not also been
carried away in long boxes; a few men who
look upon you with a kindly patronage as one
who has fallen in the fight and cannot compete
with them now; but otherwise? Your hospital
appointments have long been filled up by men
who cannot, you think, do your work half so well
as you used to do it; your car is long ago turned
into scrap-iron; your little dog, which used to
yelp so joyously when you got home tired at
night and kicked him out of the way, is long dead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
and buried under your favourite rose-bush;
your library, which was your joy for so many
years, has long been sold at about one-tenth of
what it cost you; and, except for the woman who
was foolish enough to love and marry you and
the children whom the good creature brought
into the world to carry on your name, you are
as though you had never been. Why should
this be? And why are you so terrified at the
prospect?</p>

<p>During the past few years we have had ample
experience of death, for there are few families
in Australia, and I suppose in England, France,
Germany, Italy, Russia, and Europe generally,
which have not lost some beloved member;
yet we are no nearer solving the mystery than we
were before. We know no more about it than
did Socrates or Homer. The only thing that
is beginning to haunt the minds of many men
is whether those gallant boys who died in the
war were not better off than the men who survived.
At least they know the worst, if there
be anything to know; and have no longer to
fear cancer and paralysis and the other diseases
of later life. Many men have written in a consolatory
vein about old age, but the consolants
have in no way answered the dictum that if by
reason of strength our years exceed threescore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
and ten, yet is our strength but labour and sorrow.
No doctor who has seen an old man with an
enlarged prostate and a septic kidney therefrom,
or with cancer of the tongue, can refrain from wishing
that that man had died twenty years sooner,
because however bad the fate in store for him
it can hardly be worse than what he suffers here
on earth. And possibly there are worse things
on earth even than cancer of the tongue; possibly
cancer of the bladder is the most atrocious,
or right-sided hemiplegia with its aphasia and
deadly depression of soul. Young men do not
suffer from these things; and no one can attend
a man so afflicted without wishing that the patient
had died happily by a bullet in Gallipoli before
his time came so to suffer. Yet as a man grows
older, though the likelihood of his death becomes
more and more with every passing year, his
clinging to bare life, however painful and terrible
that life may be, becomes more intense. The
young hardly seem to fear death; that is a fear
almost confined to the aged. How otherwise
can we explain the extraordinary heroism shown
by the boys of every army during the late war?
I watched many beautiful and gallant boys,
volunteers mark you, march down the streets of
Sydney on their way to a quarrel which nobody
understood—not even the German Kaiser who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>
started it; and when my own turn came to go
I patched up many thousands who had been
shattered: the one impression made upon me
was the utter vileness and beastliness of war,
and the glorious courage of the boys in the line.
Before the order went forth forbidding the use
of Liston’s long splint in the advanced dressing
stations, men with shattered lower limbs used
to be brought in with their feet turned back
to front. High-explosive shells would tear away
half the front of a man’s abdomen; men would
be maimed horribly for life, and life would never
be the same again for them. Yet none seemed to
complain. I know that our own boys simply
accepted it all as the inevitable consequence
of war, and from what I saw of the English and
French their attitude of mind was much the same.
The courage of the boys was amazing. I am
very sure that if the average age of the armies
had been sixty instead of under thirty, Amiens
would never have been saved or Fort Douaumont
recovered, nor would the Germans have fought
so heroically as we must admit they did. Old men
feel death approaching them, and they fear it.
We all know that our old patients are far more
nervous about death than the young. I remember
a girl who had sarcoma of the thigh,
which recurred after amputation, and I had to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
send her to a home for the dying. She did not
seem very much perturbed. I suppose the
proper thing to say would be that she was conscious
of her salvation and had nothing to fear;
but the truth was that she was a young rake
who had committed nearly every crime possible
to the female sex, and she died as peacefully
and happily as any young member of the Church
I ever knew. But who is so terrified as the old
woman who trips on a rough edge of the carpet
and fractures her thigh-bone? How she clings
to life! What terrors attend her last few weeks
on earth, till merciful pneumonia comes to send
her to endless sleep!</p>

<p>I do not remember to have noticed any of that
ecstasy which we are told should attend the
dying of the saved. Generally, so far as I have
observed, the dying man falls asleep some hours
or days before he actually dies, and does not
wake again. His breathing becomes more and
more feeble; his heart beats more irregularly and
feebly, and finally it does not resume; there
comes a moment when his face alters indescribably
and his jaw drops; one touches his
eyes and they do not respond; one holds a mirror
to his mouth and it is not dulled; his wife,
kneeling by the bedside, suddenly perceives that
she is a widow, and cries inconsolably; one turns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
away sore and grieved and defeated; and that
is all about it! There is no more heroism nor
pain nor agony in dying than in falling asleep
every night. Whether a man has been a good
man or a bad does not seem to make any difference.
I have seldom seen a death-agony, nor
heard a death-rattle that could be distinguished
from a commonplace snore. Possibly the muscles
may become wanting in oxygenation for some
time before actual death, and thrown into convulsive
movements like the dance of the highwayman
at Tyburn while he was dying of
strangulation, and these convulsive movements
might be looked upon as a death-agony; but I
am quite sure that the patient never feels them.
To do so would require that the sense of self-location
would persist, but what evidence we
have is that that is one of the first senses to
depart. Possibly the dying man may have some
sensation such as we have all gone through
while falling asleep—that feeling as though we
are falling, which is supposed to be a survival
from the days when we were apes; possibly
there may be some giddiness such as attends
the going under an anæsthetic, and is doubtless
to be attributed to the same loss of power of
self-location; but the impression that has been
forced upon me whenever I have seen any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
struggling has been that the movements were
quite involuntary, purposeless, and meaningless.
And anything like an agony or a death-rattle
is rare. Far more often the man simply falls
asleep, and it may be as difficult to decide when
life passes into death as it is to decide when
consciousness passes into sleep.</p>

<p>Nor have I ever heard any genuine last words
such as we read in books. I doubt if they ever
occur. At the actual time of death the man’s
body is far too busy with its dying for his mind
to formulate any ideas. The nearest approach
to a “last word” that I ever remember was when
a very old and brilliant man, who, after a lifetime
spent in the service of Australia, lay dying,
full of years and honour, from suppression of
urine that followed some weeks after an operation
on his prostate. It was early in the war, and
Austria, with her usual folly, was acting egregiously.
The nurse was trying to rouse the old
man by reading to him the war news. He suddenly
sat up, and a flash of intelligence came over
his face. “Pah—Austria with her idiot Archdukes—that
was what Bismarck said, wasn’t it?”
Then he fell back, and went to sleep; nor could
the visits of his family and the injections of saline
solution into his veins rouse him again from his
torpor. He lay unconscious for nearly a week.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
That is the only instance of the “ruling passion
strong in death” that I remember. He had
always hated Bismarck and despised the Austrians,
and for one brief moment hatred and contempt
awakened his clouded brain. And Napoleon
said, “<i>Tête d’armée</i>.”</p>

<p>There is no need, so far as we can tell, to fear
the actual dying. Death is no more to be feared
than his twin-brother Sleep, as the very ancient
Greeks of Homer surmised; it is <i>what comes after</i>
that many people fear. “To sleep—perchance
to dream” nightmares? Well, I do not know
what other people feel when they dream, but for
myself I am fortunate enough to know, even in
the midst of the most horrible nightmare, that
it is all a dream; and I dare say that this is a
privilege common to many people. The blessed
sleep that comes to tired man in the early morning,
with which cometh joy, is well worth going through
nightmare to attain; and I think I am not speaking
wildly in claiming that most men pass the
happiest portions of their lives in that early
morning sleep. One of the horrors of neurasthenia
is that early morning sleep is often denied
to the patient.</p>

<p>But the idea of hell is to many persons a real
terror, not to be overmastered by reason. God
has not made man in His own image; man has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
made God in his. As Grant Allen used to say:
“The Englishman’s idea of God is an Englishman
twelve feet high”; and the old Jews, who
were a very savage and ruthless people, created
Jehovah in their own image. To such a God
eternal punishment for a point of belief was quite
the natural thing, and nineteen centuries of
belief in the teaching of a loving and forgiving
Christ have not abolished that frightful idea.
It is one of the disservices of the Mediæval Church
to mankind that it popularized and enforced the
idea of hell, and that idea has been diligently
perpetuated by some narrow-minded sects to
this very day. But to a modern man, who, with
all his faults, is a kindly and forgiving creature,
hell is unthinkable, and he cannot bring himself
to believe that it was actually part of the teaching
of Christ. If the New Testament says so, then,
thinks the average modern man, it must be in an
interpolation by some mediæval ecclesiastic whose
zeal outran his mercy; and an average modern
man is not seriously swayed by any idea of everlasting
flames. He may even quaintly wonder,
if he has studied the known facts of the universe,
where either hell or heaven is to be found,
considering that they are supposed to have lasted
for ever and to be fated to last as long. In time
to come the souls, saved and lost, must be of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
infinite number, if they are not so already; and
an infinite number would fill all available space
and spill over for an infinite distance, leaving no
room for flames, or brimstone, or harps, or golden
cities. Perhaps it may not be beyond Almighty
Power to solve this difficulty, but it is a very
real one to the average thoughtful man. When
we begin to realize infinity, to realize that every
one of the millions of known suns must each last
for millions of years, after which the whole
process must begin again, endure as long, and so
on <i>ad infinitum</i>, the thing becomes simply inconceivable;
the mind staggers, and takes refuge
in agnosticism, which is not cured by the scoffing
of clergymen whom one suspects of not viewing
things from a modern standpoint. Jowett once
answered a young man whom he evidently looked
upon as a “puppy” by thundering at him:
“Young man, you call yourself an agnostic; let
me tell you that <i>agnostic</i> is a Greek word the
Latin of which is <i>ignoramus</i>!” Jowett evidently
did not in the least understand that young man’s
difficulties, nor the difficulties of any man whose
training has been scientific—that is, directed
towards the ascertaining what is demonstrably
true. Scoffing and insolence like that only react
upon the scoffer’s head, and rather breed contempt
than comfort. Nor is the problem of God Himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
any more easy of solution, unless we are prepared
to see Him everywhere, in every minute cell
and tiny bacterium. If we confess to such a
belief we are immediately crushed with the cry
of “mere Pantheism,” or even “Spinozism,” as
though these epithets, meant to be contemptuous,
led us any further on our way. You cannot
solve these dreadful problems by a sneer, and
Voltaire, the prince of scoffers, would have had
even more influence on thought than he had if
he had contented himself with a less aggressive
and polemic attitude towards the Church.</p>

<p>Hell is a concrete attempt at Divine punishment.
Punishment for what? For disobeying
the commandments of God? How are we to
know what God really commanded? And how are
we to weigh the relative effects of temptation and
powers of resistance upon any given man? How are
we to say that an action which in one man may be
desperately wicked may not be positively virtuous
in another? It is a commonplace that virtue
changes with latitude, and that we find “the
crimes of Clapham chaste in Martaban.” Why
should we condemn some poor maiden of Clapham
to burn for ever for a crime which she may not
recognize as a crime, whereas we applaud a damsel
of Martaban for doing precisely the same thing?
And what is sin? Is there any real evidence as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[246]</span>
to what the commandments of God really are?
Modern psychology seems to hold that virtue and
vice are simply phases of the herd-complex of
normal man, and have been evolved by the herd
during countless generations as the best method
of perpetuating the human species. No individual
man made his own herd-complex, by which
he is so enormously swayed; no individual man
made his own sex-complex, or his ego-complex,
or anything that is his. How can he be held
responsible for his actions by a God Who made
him the subject of such frightful temptations and
gave him such feeble powers of resistance?
Edward Fitzgerald—who, be it remembered,
knew no more about these things than you or I—summed
up the whole matter in “Man’s forgiveness
give—and take,” and probably this simple
line has given more comfort to thoughtful men
than all Jowett’s bluster. Fitzgerald has at least
voiced the instinctive rebellion which every man
must feel when he considers the facts of human
nature, even if he has given us otherwise no more
guidance than a call to a poor kind of Epicureanism
which lays stress on a book of verse underneath a
bough, and thou beside me singing in a wilderness.
If our musings lead us to Epicureanism, at least
let it be the Epicureanism of Epicurus, and not
the sensual pleasure-seeking of Omar. True,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>
Epicureanism laid stress on the superiority of
mental over physical happiness; it were better to
worship at the shrine of Beethoven than of Venus,
and better to take your pleasure in the library
than in the wine-shop. But nobler than Epicurus
was Zeno, the Stoic, whose influence on both the
ancient and the modern worlds has been so profound.
If we are to take philosophy as our guide,
Stoicism, which inculcates duty and self-restraint,
and is supported by the great names of Seneca,
Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius, is probably our
best leading light. Theoretically it should produce
noble characters; practically it has produced
the noblest, if the <i>Meditations</i> of Marcus Aurelius
were really written by him and not by some monk
in the Middle Ages. If we follow the teaching
of Stoicism we shall, when we come to die, at
least have the consolation that we have done our
duty; and if we realize the full meaning of
“duty” in the modern world to include duty
done kindly and generously as well as faithfully,
we shall be living as nearly to the ideals laid down
by Christ as is possible to human nature, and we
shall assuredly have nothing to fear.</p>

<p>Anæsthesia gives some faint hint as to the
possibility of a future life. It is believed that
chloroform and ether abolish consciousness by
causing a slight change in the molecular constitution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
of nervous matter, as for instance dissolving
the fatty substances or lipoids. If so
minute a change in the chemistry of nervous
matter has the power of totally abolishing consciousness,
how can the mind possibly survive
the much greater change which occurs in nervous
matter after corruption has set in? Nor has there
ever been any proof that there can be consciousness
without living nervous matter. One turns
to the spiritualistic evidence offered by Myers,
Conan Doyle, Oliver Lodge, and other observers,
but after carefully studying their reports one
feels inclined to agree with Huxley that spiritualism
has merely added a new terror to death, for,
according to the spiritualists, death appears to
transform men into idiots who on earth were
known to be able and clever, and the marvel is
not the miracles which they report, but that
clever men should be found to believe them.</p>

<p>An even more remarkable marvel than the
marvel of Lodge and Conan Doyle was the
marvel of John Henry Newman, who, a supremely
able man, living at the time of Darwin, Huxley,
and the vast biological advancement of the
Victorian era, was yet able in middle life to embrace
the far from rationalistic doctrines of the
Roman Catholic Church. That he was tempted
to do so by the opportunity which his action gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>
him of becoming a prince of the Church is too
ridiculous an assumption to stand for a moment.
The man <i>believed</i> these things, and believed them
with greatness, nobility, and earnestness; when
he ’verted he was forty-four years of age, and it
was not for about thirty years that he was created
a cardinal. The only explanation that can be
given is that we have not yet fathomed the depths
of the human mind; there is a certain type of
mind which appears to see things by what it calls
intuition and is not open to reason on the basis
of evidence or probability.</p>

<p>Probably what most men fear is not death but
the pain and illness which generally precede death;
and apart from that very natural dread there is
the dread of leaving things which are dear to
every one. After all, life is sweet to most of us;
it is pleasant to feel the warm sun and see the blue
sky and watch the shadows race over far hills;
an occasional concert, a week-end spent at golf, or
at working diligently in the garden; congenial
employment, or a worthy book to read, all help
to make life worth living, and the mind becomes
sad at the thought of leaving these things and the
home which they epitomize. I remember once
in a troopship, a few days out from an Australian
port, when the men had all got over their sea-sickness
and were beginning to realize that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
really were started on their Great Adventure,
that I went down into their quarters at night,
and found a big young countryman who had
enlisted in the Artillery, sobbing bitterly. It was
a long time before kindly consolation and a dose
of bromide sent him off to sleep. In the morning
he came to see me and tried to apologize for his
unmanliness. “I’m not afraid of dyin’, sir,” he
explained. “I want to stoush some of them
Germans first, though. It’s leaving all me life
in Australia if I ’appen to stop a lump of lead, sir—that’s
what’s worryin’ me.” Life in Australia
meant riding on horseback when he was not
following at the plough’s tail. It was the only
life he knew, and he loved it. But I was fully
convinced that he no more feared actual death
than he feared a mosquito, and when he left the
ship at Suez, and joined lustily in the singing
of “Australia will be there”—who so jovial as
he? He got through the fighting on Gallipoli,
only to be destroyed on the Somme; his horse,
if it had not already been sent to Palestine, had
to submit to another rider; his acres to produce
for another ploughman.</p>

<p>The last illness is, of course, sometimes very
unpleasant, especially if cancer or angina pectoris
enter into the picture, but I have often marvelled
at the endurance of men who should, according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
to all one’s preconceived ideas, be broken up with
distress. Not uncommonly a man refuses to
believe that he is really so seriously ill as other
people think, and there is always the hope eternal
in every breast that he will get better. Quite
commonly he looks hopefully in the glass every
morning as he shaves for signs of coming improvement;
there are few men who really believe that
sentence of early death has been passed upon
them.</p>

<p>The illness which causes the most misery is an
illness complicated with neurasthenia, and probably
the neurasthenic tastes the bitterest misery
of which mankind is capable, unless we admit
melancholia into the grisly competition. But I
often think that the long sleepless early morning
hours of neurasthenia, when the patient lies
listening for the chimes, worrying over his physical
condition and harassed with dread of the
future, are the most terrible possible to man.
Nor are they in any way improved by the knowledge
that sometimes neurasthenia does not
indicate any real physical disease.</p>

<p>But it is difficult to find any really rational
cause for the desire to live longer, unless Sir
Thomas Browne is right in thinking that the
long habit of living indisposeth us for dying.
After all, what does it really matter whether we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
die to-morrow or live twenty more years? In
another century it will be all the same; at most
we but postpone dissolution. Death has to come
sooner or later; and whatever we believe of our
life beyond the grave is not likely to make any
difference. We were not consulted as to whether
we were to be born, nor as to the parts and capabilities
which were to be allotted to us, and it
is exceedingly unlikely that our wishes will be
taken into consideration as regards our eternal
disposition. We can do no more when we come
to die than take our involuntary leap into the
dark like innumerable living creatures before
us, and, conscious of having done our duty
to the best that lay in us, hope for the
best.</p>

<p>Twentieth-century biological science appears
to result in a kind of vague pantheism, coupled
with a generous hedonism. Scientific men appear
to find their pleasure, not like the old Greeks,
sought by each man for himself, but rather in
“the greatest happiness of the greatest number.”
It is difficult for a modern man to feel entirely
happy while he knows of the vast amount of
incurable misery that exists in the world. The
idea of Heaven is simply an idea that the atrocious
injustice and unhappiness of life in this world
must be balanced by equally great happiness in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
the life to come; but is there any evidence to
favour such a belief? Is there any evidence
throughout Nature that the spirit of justice is
anything but a dream of man himself which is
never to be fulfilled? We do not like to speak of
“death,” but prefer rather to avoid the hated
term by some journalistic periphrasis, such as
“solved the great enigma.” But is there any
enigma? Or are we going to solve it? Is it not
more likely that our protoplasm is destined to
become dissolved into its primordial electrons,
and ultimately to be lost in the general ocean of
ether, and that when we die we shall solve
no enigma, because there is no enigma to
solve?</p>

<p>To sum up, death probably does not hurt
nearly so much as the ordinary sufferings which
are the lot of everybody in living; the act of
death is probably no more terrible than our
nightly falling asleep; and probably the condition
of everlasting rest is what Fate has in store
for us, and we can face it bravely without flinching
when our time comes. But whether we flinch or
not will not matter; we have to die all the same,
and we shall be less likely to flinch if we can feel
that we have tried to do our duty. And what
are we to say of a man who has seen his duty, and
urgently longed to perform it, but has failed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
because God has not given him sufficient strength?
“Video meliora proboque, deteriora sequor,”
as old Cicero said of himself. If there is any
enigma at all, it lies in the frustrated longings and
bitter disappointment of that man.</p>

<p>Probably the best shield throughout life against
the atrocious evils and injustices which every man
has to suffer is a kind of humorous fatalism which
holds that other people have suffered as much as
ourselves; that such suffering is a necessary concomitant
of life upon this world; and that nothing
much matters so long as we do our duty in the
sphere to which Fate has called us. A kindly
irony which enables us to laugh at the world and
sympathize with its troubles is a very powerful
aid in the battle; and if a doctor does his part in
alleviating pain and postponing death—if he does
his best for rich and poor, and always listens to the
cry of the afflicted,—and if he endeavours to
leave his wife and children in a position better
than he himself began, I do not see what more
can be expected of him either in this world or the
next. And probably Huxley was not far wrong
when he said: “I have no faith, very little hope,
and as much charity as I can afford.” It is
amazing that there are some people in the world
to-day who look upon a man who professes these
merciful sentiments as a miscreant doomed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
eternal flames because he will not profess to
believe in their own particular form of religion.
They think they have answered him when they
proclaim that his creed is sterile.</p>

<p class="ph1">FOOTNOTES:</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[1]</a> I have read or heard that one of the charges against Cardinal
Wolsey was that he had given the King syphilis by whispering
in his ear. The nature of the story so whispered is not disclosed,
but may be imagined. But the proud prelate had several
perfectly healthy illegitimate children, and on the whole it is
probable that Henry caught the disease in the usual way.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> They really seem to have taken some little pains to make
the death of the King’s old flame as little terrible as possible.
They might have burnt her or subjected her to the usual grim
preliminaries of the scaffold. Probably they did this not
because the King had ever loved her, but because she was a
queen, and therefore not to be subjected to needless infamy;
one of the Lord’s anointed, in short.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3" href="#FNanchor_3" class="label">[3]</a> To pause for a moment, probably the element of human
sacrifice may have entered into the hair-cutting episode, as it
did in the action of the women of Carthage during the last
siege; and possibly there may have been some shamefaced
reserve in the attributing of the fashion to the example of an
egregious “Buster Brown” of New York. To my own memory
the fashion was first called either the “Joan of Arc” cut or
the “Munitioner” cut. The “Buster Brown” cut came
later, and seems to have been seized upon by the English as
an excuse against showing deep feelings. It is pleasanter to
think that Joan of Arc was really at that time in the hearts of
English women; the cult of semi-worship that so strengthened
the Allies was really worship of the qualities which mankind
has read into the memory of the little maid of Domremy. As
she raised the siege of Orleans, so her memory encouraged the
Allies to persevere through years of agony nearly as great
as her own.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">[4]</a> We can see from the statues of Jeanne d’Arc how near akin
are the sex-complex and the art-complex. I do not refer to
the innumerable pretty statues scattered throughout the French
churches, which are merely ideal portraits of sainted women.
The magnificent equestrian statue by Fremiet in the Place des
Pyramides, Paris, is a portrait of a plump little French peasant-girl
trying to look fierce, and succeeding about as well as Audrey
might if she tried to play Lady Macbeth. But it is essentially
female, and, in my idea of Jeanne d’Arc, is therefore wrong,
for we really know nothing about her beyond what we read in
the trials. Even more female is the statue of her by Romaneill
in the Melbourne Art Gallery, in which the artist has actually
depicted the corslet as curved to accommodate moderate-sized
breasts, a thing which would probably have shocked Jeanne
herself, for she wished to make herself sexually unattractive.
The face, though common, is probably accurate in that it
depicts her expression as saintly. No doubt when she was
listening to her Voices she did look dreamy and ethereal. But
we have no authority for believing that she was in the slightest
degree beautiful—if anything, she was probably rather the reverse.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
